# Create, edit and share *visually* with the Stately Studio

[The Stately handbook](/handbook/state-machines-and-statecharts)
[Get started with XState](/getting-started/installation)

Our [Stately Studio](https://stately.ai) tools help you create and edit state machines with no code or low code. Get an overview of your application logic at a glance and dig into the details to prevent bugs and write better code. Share your application logic with your team, even those who don’t read code. You can also visualize your existing state machines, edit them, and sync your changes into your code.

- [Try the Stately visual editor](https://stately.ai/editor)
- [Get the XState VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=statelyai.stately-vscode)
- [Discover new machines in the Stately studio](https://stately.ai/registry/discover)

## Why statecharts and state machines?

A state machine is a model that describes how the state of a process transitions to another state when an event occurs. State machines make building reliable software easier because they prevent impossible states and undesired transitions. [Statecharts](/handbook/state-machines-and-statecharts) are a visual extension to state machines enabling you to model more complex logic, including hierarchy, concurrency, and communication.

You may have used similar diagrams in the past to design user flows, plan data transformations or map app logic. Statecharts are another way of using boxes and arrows to represent these kinds of flows. These flows are also executable code you can use to control the logic directly in your application code.

## Robust application logic anywhere that JavaScript runs

XState is a JavaScript library for [state machines and statecharts](#why-statecharts-and-state-machines), making building reliable software easier by preventing impossible states and undesired transitions.

- Create machines visually with the [Stately editor](https://stately.ai).
- [Install XState](/getting-started/installation) [using your favorite package manager](/getting-started/installation#installation-snippets) or [with a CDN](/getting-started/installation#cdn).
- [Read our handbook to learn more about state machines and statecharts](/handbook/state-machines-and-statecharts).
- [Use a template](/templates) for your favorite framework, or go framework-free.
