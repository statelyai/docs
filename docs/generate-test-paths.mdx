title: Generate test paths
---

You can generate test path code for your state machines from the <ClipboardCheck size={18}/> **Tests** panel, which you can use to implement tests in your code. Both setup code and test code for each path is generated.

This feature is currently in beta and [we’d love to hear your feedback](https://discord.stately.ai).

**Generate test paths** is a paid feature of Stately Studio. You can try Stately Studio’s paid plans with a free trial. [Check out the features on our Pro plan](studio-pro-plan.mdx), [Team plan](studio-team-plan.mdx), [Enterprise plan](studio-enterprise-plan.mdx) or [upgrade your existing plan](https://stately.ai/registry/billing).

## Path generation strategy

You can choose between two path generation strategies:

- **Shortest path**: Generate paths that cover the shortest possible paths through your state machine and minimizes the number of actions required to test functionality.
- **Simplest path**: Generate paths that cover the simplest paths, often known as “happy paths”, through your state machine and helps verify that basic functionality is working as expected.

## Testing frameworks

Generate test paths currently supports [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) and custom testing framework formats. We plan to add more testing frameworks (including Puppeteer, Cypress, and even other languages) in the future.

## Options

- **Reduce duplicate paths** generates fewer paths that also cover other paths.
- **Prefer transition coverage** generates paths that cover all transitions in your state machine.
- **Highlight paths** enables highlighting the paths on the canvas when you hover over its test path description.
- **AI-generated test titles** (experimental) generates more readable test titles based on your state machine. AI-generated test titles send your state machine to OpenAI to generate the titles.
