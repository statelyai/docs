title: Export as code

import { Code, MoreHorizontal, ShareIcon, Upload } from 'lucide-react';

Exporting as code is useful if you want to use your machine with [XState](xstate/intro.mdx) inside your codebase or if you want to duplicate your machine without using **Fork**.

You can currently export your machine as JSON, JavaScript, and TypeScript code using the code panel in the right tool menu. You can also export as code from the **Export machine** dialog using the export icon button in the editor’s top bar.

## Export code from the code panel
