title: Export as code
---

Exporting as code is useful if you want to use your machine with [XState](xstate.mdx) inside your codebase or if you want to duplicate your machine without using **Fork**.

Every feature of your state machine will be included in the code, except for colors and annotations.

## Export formats

You can currently export your machine as:

- JSON code for use with XState
- JavaScript code for use with XState
- TypeScript code for use with XState
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org) code and diagrams for use in GitHub, GitLab, and anywhere Mermaid is supported

You can now export to Mermaid code and diagrams.

## How to export as code

You can export as code by:

- Using the <Code size={18} /> **Code** panel in the right tool menu
- Using the <MoreHorizontal size={18} /> menu alongside the machine name in the machines list
- Using the <Upload size={18} /> export icon button in the header

You can also [import from code](import-from-code.mdx) in any of these locations.

:::tip

Wrap your Mermaid code in a fenced code block with the `mermaid` language identifier to [share your diagram on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams#creating-mermaid-diagrams) and [share your diagram on GitLab](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/mermaid/).
