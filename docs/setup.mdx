title: 'Setup'
---

In XState version 5, you can now use the `setup({ ... })` function to setup types and sources for your machines. This has many benefits:

- Reduced boilerplate for strongly typing and providing named sources
- More robust machine logic, as named sources are guaranteed to exist
- Better type inference for actions, actors, guards, delays, context, events, etc.
- Strongly-typed snapshot and done events for actors
- Strongly-typed state values
- Reusability of source logic

Example usage:

```ts
import { setup, assign } from 'xstate';

const machine = setup({
  types: {
    context: {} as { count: number },
    events: {} as 
      | { type: 'inc' }
      | { type: 'dec' }
  },
  actions: {
    increment: assign({
      count: ({ context }) => context.count + 1
    }),
    decrement: assign({
      count: ({ context }) => context.count - 1
    })
  }
}).createMachine({
  context: { count: 0 },
  on: {
    inc: { actions: 'increment' },
    dec: { actions: 'decrement' }
  }
})
```

Ensure you are using the latest version of TypeScript (version 5.0 or higher). See the docs on [TypeScript usage with XState](./typescript.mdx) for more information.

## Setting up types

Machine types should be setup in the `types` property of `setup({ types })`. This is where you can setup the types for your machine, including:

- Types for `context`
- Types for `events`, including event payloads
- Types for `input`
- Types for `actions`, including action `params`
- Types for `guards`, including guard `params`
- Types for `actors`



## Migrating from `createMachine`

Migrating from bare `createMachine({ ... })` to `setup({ ... }).createMachine({ ... })` to create a machine is simple.

1. Import `setup` instead of `createMachine` from `'xstate'`
1. Move `types` from `createMachine(...)` to `setup(...)`
1. Move action, actor, guard, etc. sources from the 2nd argument of `createMachine(config, sources)` to `setup({ ... })`

```ts
import {
// createMachine
  setup
} from 'xstate';

const machine =
  setup({
    types: { ... },
    actions: { ... },
    guards: { ... }
  })
  .createMachine({
    // types: { ... }
  }, /* { actions, guards, ... } */);
```
