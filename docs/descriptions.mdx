You can add descriptions to state and event nodes to describe their purpose and share related notes with your team. Descriptions support markdown formatting, including links and images.

The machine object will include your descriptions in the state or event's `description` when you export your statecharts to JSON.

<EmbedMachine name="Video player" embedURL="https://stately.ai/registry/editor/embed/e13bef2b-bb13-4465-96ac-0bc25340688e?machineId=574ede8a-a328-40fe-a4f9-c80fffb2c30a" />

In the video player above, the text “The video player should be in full-screen mode” is a description of the *Opened* event.
