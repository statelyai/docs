Find more about our [XState VS Code extension](#xstate-vscode-extension), [XState CLI (Command Line Interface)](#xstate-cli-command-line-interface) and [Chrome Devtools](#chrome-devtools) below. We plan to make extensions for more IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) in the future.

## XState VS Code extension

The [XState VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=statelyai.stately-vscode) enhances the XState development experience by providing VS Code users with autocomplete, typegen, linting, and Studio Editor visual editing from inside VS Code.

:::tip

If you don’t use VS Code but use an open source code editor that supports VS Code extensions, you can [download the XState VS Code extension from the OpenVSX registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/statelyai/stately-vscode).

:::

### Installation

1. Open the command palette with `shift` + `cmd/ctrl` + `p`.
2. Search for the Install Extensions command and hit enter to open the Extensions search.
3. Search for XState to find the XState VS Code extension and install the extension using the Install button.

Once installed, you can run `XState: Open Visual Editor` from the command palette to open any machine at your cursor’s location.

If you have code lens enabled (this can be enabled using `editor.codeLens` setting), ‘Open Visual Editor’ will also float above each `createMachine` call.

You can also [download the VS Code extension from the VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=statelyai.stately-vscode) or [download the VS Code extension from the Open VSX marketplace](https://open-vsx.org/extension/statelyai/stately-vscode).

### Features

- **Visually edit machines**. Edit any XState machine with drag-and-drop using the integrated [Stately Visual editor](https://stately.ai/editor).
- **Autocomplete**. Intelligent suggestions for transition targets and initial states.
- **Linting**. Highlights errors and potential bugs in your XState machine definitions.
- **Jump to definition**. Navigate around machines easily with jump to definition on targets, actions, guards, actors and more.

### TypeScript typegen

You can automatically generate intelligent typings for XState with our VS Code extension and [command line interface](/developer-tools#xstate-cli-command-line-interface). [Read more about how to use typegen, and our recommended best practices, on the Typegen page](/xstate/typescript/typegen).

### `xsm` snippet

Use the `xsm` snippet to generate the code required for your state machine quickly. [Watch the ‘XState + VS Code: xsm snippet’ video (1m23s)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gk3mdlqadYM) for a demo.

### Refactors

When hovering over a named action, guard or actor in a machine, press the lightbulb icon to view available refactors.

### Ignoring machines

If you’d like to ignore linting/autocomplete on a machine, add an `// xstate-ignore-next-line` comment on the line above the machine:

```js
// xstate-ignore-next-line
createMachine({});
```

## XState CLI (Command Line Interface)

The [@xstate/cli (Command Line Interface) package](https://github.com/statelyai/xstate-tools/tree/master/apps/cli) contains commands for running typegen. The package is small right now, but we plan to add more features.

### Installation

Run `npm install @xstate/cli`.

### Commands

#### `xstate typegen <files>`

Use the following command to run the typegen against a glob.

`xstate typegen "src/**/*.ts?(x)"`

Running typegen will scan every targeted file and generate a typegen file to accompany it. It will also import the typegen into your file, as described in [our typegen documentation](/typescript/typegen).

:::caution

Ensure you wrap your glob in quotes for correct execution. If you don’t wrap the glob in quotes, it will be interpreted as a list of files, not a glob, which will give unexpected results.

:::

#### Options

`xstate typegen "src/**/*.ts?(x)" --watch`

Runs the task on a watch, monitoring for changed files and running the typegen script against them.

## Chrome Devtools

<!-- TODO: What are the Chrome devtools? -->

### Quick Start

- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm start` to build the `/panel` in development mode.
- Go to [`chrome://extensions`](chrome://extensions) and **Load unpacked** this directory (`/packages/xstate-dev`).
- Select the `XState` extension in the dev tools.
