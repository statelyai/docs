# Stately Studio


One of XState’s most powerful features is the ability to build and maintain code _visually_. Using statecharts, a visual language using boxes and arrows, we can capture business-critical code in diagrams that are understandable to non-devs and visually editable.

Stately’s [visual editor](https://stately.ai/editor?source=docs) has first-class support for XState, meaning you can **build and edit statecharts on a drag-and-drop canvas**.

## Features

The editor supports everything you need to build state machines and statecharts.



- Atomic, parent, child, parallel, history, and final states
- Normal, guarded, and delayed events/transitions
- Entry, exit, and transition actions
- Invocations
- Done and error transitions for states and invocations
- State and event descriptions

The editor currently has two modes:

- **Editor mode**: add, modify, and delete states, events, and transitions, as well as data including actions, descriptions, and invocations.
- **Simulation mode**: run the statechart, trigger events, and see the active state nodes.

You can also **export machines to JSON**, ready to be used in your codebase with XState.
