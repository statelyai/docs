The [Stately Visualizer](https://stately.ai/viz) is a tool for creating and inspecting statecharts to visualize the state of your applications. You can use the viz as a playground for exploring XState’s capabilities.

:::tip

Stately still supports the Stately Visualizer, but you will find many more advanced features, including the visual [Studio Editor](studio.mdx/#studio-editor), teams, and shared projects.

:::

As a visual tool, the Visualizer helps developers get an overview of their application logic and makes it easy to share with designers, project managers and the rest of the team.

- Write your application logic and immediately visualize it.
- Save your statecharts to the Stately Registry and share them with anybody.
- Share your statecharts in your team’s documentation with embedded mode and live-updating snapshot images.

## Try the Visualizer

The Visualizer is available now and will be free and open source forever. Contributions are welcome!
