# Upgrade

**Stately Studio will always be free to our Community users** on the [Community plan](studio-community-plan.mdx), and we will make many future features available on every plan.

We offer a **free trial** on the Stately Studio [Pro](studio-pro-plan.mdx), [Team](studio-team-plan.mdx), or [Enterprise](studio-enterprise-plan.mdx) plans so you can explore how our premium features work for you and your team. You can [upgrade](upgrade.mdx) when you’re signed into Stately Studio.

## Upgrade to a Pro or Team plan

You can [upgrade](upgrade.mdx) when you’re signed into Stately Studio using the **Upgrade** button in the editor’s footer.
