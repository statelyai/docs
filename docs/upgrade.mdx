# Upgrade

**The Stately Studio will always be free to our Community users** on the [Community plan](/studio-community-plan.mdx), and we will make many future features available on every plan.

We offer a **30-day free trial** on the [Stately Studio Pro account](/studio-pro-plan.mdx) so you can explore how our Pro features work for you and your team.

## Upgrade to a Pro plan

You can [upgrade](/upgrade.mdx) when you’re signed into the Stately Studio using the **Upgrade** button in the Editor’s header.
