title: Callback Actors
---

Callback actors are actors whose logic is represented by a function that can "callback" to the parent actor by sending events (via `sendBack(...)`). It can also `receive(...)` events from other actors.

## Callback actor capabilities

| | Capability | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | Receive&nbsp;events | Callback actors can receive events via the `receive(event => {...})` function. |
| ✅ | Send events | Callback actors can send events to its parent via `sendBack(event)`, or to other actors it has reference to, such as those provided in its `input`. |
| ❌ | Spawn actors | Callback actors currently cannot spawn new actors. |
| ✅ | Input | You can provide `input` to callback actors. |
| ❌ | Output | Callback actors currently do not produce output – they are active indefinitely until they are stopped or an error occurs. |

## Callback actor logic

You can define callback actor logic using the `fromCallback(...)` actor logic creator, which takes a callback function and returns actor logic that can be used to create callback actors.

```ts
import { createActor, createMachine, fromCallback, sendTo, setup } from 'xstate';

const resizeLogic = fromCallback(({ sendBack, receive }) => {
  const resizeHandler = (event) => {
    sendBack(event);
  };

  window.addEventListener('resize', resizeHandler);

  const removeListener = () => {
    window.removeEventListener('resize', resizeHandler);
  }

  receive(event => {
    if (event.type === 'stopListening') {
      console.log('Stopping listening');
      removeListener();
    }
  })

  // Cleanup function
  return () => {
    console.log('Cleaning up');
    removeListener();
  }
});

const machine = setup({
  actors: {
    resizeLogic
  }
}).createMachine({
  invoke: {
    id: 'resize',
    src: 'resizeLogic'
  },
  on: {
    stop: {
      actions: sendTo('resize', { type: 'stopListening' })
    }
  }
});

const actor = createActor(machine);
actor.start();

actor.send({ type: 'stop' });
// logs "Stopping listening" from callback actor

actor.stop();
// logs "Cleaning up" from callback actor
```

## Callback actor input

_Coming soon..._

```ts
import { fromCallback, createActor, setup } from 'xstate';

const resizeLogic = fromCallback(({ sendBack, receive, input }) => {
  input.defaultSize; // 100
  // ...
});

const machine = setup({
  actors: {
    resizeLogic
  }
}).createMachine({
  // ...
  invoke: {
    src: 'resizeLogic',
    input: {
      defaultSize: 100
    }
  }
});
```
