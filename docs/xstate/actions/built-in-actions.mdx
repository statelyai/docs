# Built-in actions

Along with `assign`, XState has several other built-in actions which can do different things in a state machine. We’ll introduce a couple of built-in actions for now and learn about the others later.

## Send action

<!-- deps:
  ["actions", "transitions-and-events", "self-transitions"] -->

XState’s built-in `send` action is useful for when statecharts need to send events back to themselves.

When the send action is executed, it sends an event back to the machine _as if it were from an external source_.

This pattern can help compose different flows together. In the example below, the user can either press the `copy` button or press `ctrl + c` to fire a `COPY` event to the machine. Using the `send` action to fire the same event from both actions reduces duplication.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine, send } from 'xstate';

const keyboardShortcutMachine = createMachine({
  on: {
    PRESS_COPY_BUTTON: {
      actions: send({ type: 'COPY' }),
    },
    PRESS_CTRL_C: {
      actions: send({ type: 'COPY' }),
    },
    COPY: {
      actions: 'copyToClipboard',
    },
  },
});
```

You can also dynamically specify the event to send by passing a function to `send`:

```ts twoslash
import { send } from 'xstate';
// ---cut---
send((context, event) => {
  return {
    type: 'SOME_EVENT',
  };
});
```

## Pure action

<!-- deps: ["actions", "self-transitions"] -->

The `pure` action is useful when you need to run a dynamic number of actions depending on the current machine’s state.

`pure` lets you pass a function to the machine, which calculates the type and number of actions to be executed.

In the example below, we check `context` to find which actions the machine should run.

<!-- Remove noErrors when pure TS issue (https://github.com/statelyai/xstate/pull/3233) is fixed-->

```ts twoslash
// @noErrors
import { actions, createMachine } from 'xstate';

const { pure } = actions;

createMachine({
  context: {
    runBothActions: false,
  },
  entry: pure((context) => {
    if (context.runBothActions) {
      // You can return an array of actions
      return ['action1', 'action2'];
    }
    // Or a single action
    return 'action1';
  }),
});
```

## Rules of built-in actions

<!-- deps: ["actions", "assign-action"] -->

Built-in actions are _pure functions_. Pure functions don’t execute anything themselves but instead return instructions that tells XState what to do.

For example, the assign function returns an object containing `type: 'xstate.assign'` and an `assigner` function.

```ts twoslash
import { assign } from 'xstate';

const assignResult = assign((context, event) => ({
  newValue: true,
}));

assignResult.type; // 'xstate.assign'
assignResult.assigner; // (context, event) => ({ newValue: true })
```

The instruction set above is interpreted by XState, which executes the code. The result of `assign` must be passed directly to `actions`, `entry` or `exit`.

For example, the following code won’t work correctly because the result of the `assign` isn’t being passed into `assignToContext`.

```ts twoslash {8-14}
// @noErrors
import { createMachine, assign } from 'xstate';

const machine = createMachine(
  {
    // ...config
  },
  {
    actions: {
      assignToContext: (context, event) => {
        // 🚫 This won’t work!
        // The result of the assign isn’t being passed
        // into assignToContext
        assign({
          message: 'Hello!',
        });
      },
    },
  }
);
```

The following example works correctly because the result of the `assign` is passed into `assignToContext`:

```ts twoslash {7-11}
// @noErrors
import { createMachine, assign } from 'xstate';

const machine = createMachine(
  {
    // ...config
  },
  {
    actions: {
      assignToContext: assign((context) => ({
        message: 'Hello!',
      })),
    },
  }
);
```

## Summary

`send` can be used to send events back to your machine. `pure` can be used to dynamically return different actions. Built-in actions must be passed directly to the machine or returned from `pure`.
