Watch our [“Transitions and events” video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qgP4RZyq58&list=PLvWgkXBB3dd4I_l-djWVU2UGPyBgKfnTQ&index=4) (1m50s).

A machine moves from state to state through **transitions**. Transitions are caused by events; when an event happens, the machine transitions to the next state.

Transitions are “deterministic”; each combination of state and event always points to the same next state.

The arrows are transitions, and the rounded rectangles on the arrow’s lines are events. Each transition has a **source** state which comes before the transition, and a **target** state, which comes after the transition. The transition’s arrow starts from the source state and points to the target state.

In the video player machine above, the events are *PLAY* and *PAUSE*. The *Play* event transitions from the *Paused* state to the *Playing* state. The *Pause* event transitions from the *Playing* state to the *Paused* state.

### How to add a transition and event

1. Select your machine or an existing state.
2. Drag from the handles on the left, right and bottom sides of the selected state, and release to create a connecting transition, event and new state.
