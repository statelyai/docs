You can add source code for [actors](actors.mdx), [actions](actions.mdx), and [guards](guards.mdx) from the <Code size={18} /> **Sources** panel. Your source code will be included in your [live actors](stately-sky-getting-started.mdx), [synced projects](import-from-github.mdx), and [exported code](export-as-code.mdx) found in the <Code size={18} /> **Code** panel.

:::info

Sources for [delayed (after) transitions](delayed-transitions.mdx) are coming soon.

## Adding sources

You can add sources from the <Code size={18}/> **Sources** panel. Use the <PenSquare size={18} /> edit button alongside the action, actor, or guard on the canvas to open its source.

You can also open the **Sources** panel without an action, actor, or guard selected. By default, the **Sources** panel shows all the sources in the machine, and you can also add new sources without associating them with an action, actor, or guard. Sources that are currently referenced in the machine are highlighted in the **Sources** panel. Unused sources are dimmed.

Each source has a name (ID) and source code. The ID is used to reference the source code. The source code will be included in the generated code for the actor, action, or guard.

### Unnamed actions, actors, and guards

When importing a machine from your codebase, we’ll give them a default name based on its position in your machine config. For example the following action:

```js
createMachine({
	entry: assign(: 1)
})
```

Would be given a default name of `#machine name.a.b.entry[1]`. These default names are not visible in the editor, but will be used in the synced or exported code, unless you give your action, actor, or guard a name. After first importing your machine, we recommend you give all your actions, actors, and guards a name. This is a one-time step, and you can always rename them later.

## Deleting sources

You can only delete unused sources that are not referenced by any actors, actions, or guards. This prevents you from accidentally deleting a source that’s currently used in your machine.

:::tip

You can **delete all unused sources** from the **...** menu in the top right corner of the **Sources** panel.

## Source templates

Each source type has optional logic templates. You can use the template buttons to quickly add the implementation code for XState’s [logic creators](/docs/actors#actor-logic-creators), [higher-level guards](/docs/guards#higher-level-guards), and [built-in actions](/docs/actions), and the correct XState imports will be added to your code for sync or export.

## Formatting

You can format your source code with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) by using the <TextQuote size={18} /> format button.
