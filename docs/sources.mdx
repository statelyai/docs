You can add source code for [actors](actors.mdx), [actions](actions.mdx), and [guards](guards.mdx) from the <Code size={18} /> **Sources** panel. Your source code will be included in your [live actors](stately-sky-getting-started.mdx), [synced projects](import-from-github.mdx), and [exported code](export-as-code.mdx) found in the <Code size={18} /> **Code** panel.

Each source has an ID and source code. The ID is used to reference the source code. The source code will be included in the generated code for the actor, action, or guard.

Sources that are currently referenced in the machine are highlighted in the **Sources** panel. Unused sources are dimmed.

:::tip

You can **delete all unused sources** from the **...** menu in the top right corner of the **Sources** panel. Unused sources are sources that are not referenced by any actors, actions, or guards.

## Source templates

Each source type has templates you can use to get started. Press the template button to populate the source code textarea with the template code.

## Formatting

You can format your source code with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) by using the <TextQuote size={18} /> format button.
