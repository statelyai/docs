title: Delayed (after) transitions in Stately’s editor
---

[**Delayed transitions**](delayed-transitions.mdx) are transitions that only happen after a set amount of time. Delayed transitions are handy for building timeouts and intervals into your application logic. If another event occurs before the end of the timer, the transition doesn’t complete.

In Stately, delayed transitions are labeled “after.”

## Make an event into a delayed transition

Delayed transitions have a default time interval of 500ms (0.5 seconds).

### On the canvas

1. Select the event you want to replace with a delayed transition.
1. Right-click the event to open the edit menu.
1. From the **Event type** options, choose **After** to turn the event into a delayed transition.

### Using the transition Details panel

1. Open the transition <Info size={18} /> **Details** panel from the right tool menu.
2. From the **Event type** dropdown menu, choose **After** to turn the event into a delayed transition.

### Specify delay time

Your delay time interval will be displayed in a human-readable format on hover. For example, 15000ms will be displayed as 15 seconds.

1. Select the delayed transition.
2. Open the transition <Info size={18} /> **Details** panel from the right tool menu.
3. Use the **Delay** text input to specify the interval in milliseconds.
