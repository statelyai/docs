title: Generate React app
---

**Generate React app** is an experimental feature that helps you generate a basic React app from your state machine. 

In the <Code size={18} /> **Code** panel, use **Generate React app** to generate the files required to run a React app using your state machine. You can copy the code from the generated files, or use **Open Sandbox** to open your generated React app in CodeSandbox. You can also [use the **Enhance app** button](#enhance-app) to generate a React UI using Stately AI.

Generate React app generates code for use with [XState V5](xstate.mdx). [Read about how to migrate from XState V4 to V5](migration.mdx).

When you use **Enhance app**, your state machine and generated React app are sent to OpenAI to generate the enhanced app.
