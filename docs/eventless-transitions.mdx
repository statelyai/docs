title: Eventless (always) transitions
---

import SkipDownLink from '@site/src/components/SkipDownLink';

**Eventless transitions** are transitions that happen without an explicit event. These transitions are *always* taken when the transition is enabled.

Eventless transitions are labeled “always” and often referred to as “always” transitions.

```ts
{
  states: {
    form: {
      initial: 'valid',
      states: {
        valid: {},
        invalid: {}
      },
      always: {
        guard: 'isValid',
        target: 'valid',
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Eventless transitions and guards

Eventless transitions are taken immediately after normal transitions are taken. They are only taken if enabled, for example, if their [guards](guards.mdx) are true. This makes eventless transitions helpful in doing things when some condition is true.

## Avoid infinite loops

:::warningxstate

Since unguarded “always” transitions always run, you should be careful not to create an infinite loop.

:::

Eventless transitions with no `target` nor `guard` will cause an infinite loop. Transitions using `guard` and `actions` may run into an infinite loop if its `guard` keeps returning true.

You should define eventless transitions either with:

- `target`
- `guard` + `target`
- `guard` + `actions`
- `guard` + `target` + `actions`

If `target` is declared, the value should differ from the current state node.

Coming soon… example `{ always: { ... } }`

## When to use

Eventless transitions can be helpful when a state change is necessary, but there is no specific trigger for that change.

Coming soon… examples

## TypeScript

Eventless transitions can potentially be enabled by any event, so the `event` type is the union of all possible events.

```ts
const machine = createMachine({
  types: {} as {
    events: { type: 'greet'; message: string } | { type: 'submit' };
  },
  // ...
  always: {
    actions: ({ event }) => {
      event.type; // 'greet' | 'submit'
    },
    guard: ({ event }) => {
      event.type; // 'greet' | 'submit'
    },
  },
});
```
