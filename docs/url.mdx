title: Share machines using their share URL
---

You can share machines with your team or publicly with the machine URL.

Your machine will only be viewable if:

- the project visibility is **public**
- the project visibility is **unlisted**
- the project visibility is **private**, and the viewer is also a member of your team

Private machines stored in My Projects will only be viewable by you.

Read [how to change a project’s visibility settings](projects.mdx#change-a-projects-visibility).

## Copy the URL from the browser address bar

You can copy the machine URL from the browser address bar, which will share the machine in your current view and version.

## Copy the URL from the Share modal

1. Use the **Share** button in Stately Studio’s top bar to open the Share dialog.
2. Use the **Copy share URL** button to copy the machine’s URL to your clipboard.

## Machine URL parameters

Depending on where you copy your URL from, it may contain the following parameters:

- **machineId**: the unique ID for the machine. For example, `machineId=491a4c60-5300-4e22-92cf-8a32a8ffffca`.
- **mode**: the current machine mode. For example, `mode=Simulate`.
- **version**: the current [machine version](versions.mdx). For example, `version=78730cff-1e90-4190-9e41-426733b71c9f`.
