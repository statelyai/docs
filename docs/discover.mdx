Are you seeking inspiration for your machine? Or do you want to learn how somebody else models their machines? The [Discover page](https://stately.ai/registry/discover) lists all the public machines created with Stately Studio.

With the search feature, you can quickly filter your results by the number of states in a machine and whether the machine’s creator used [our Studio editor](https://stately.ai/editor) or our older [Viz](https://stately.ai/viz) tool. Each machine listed details its creator, number of states, and a link to view and edit the machine in the editor.

## Export and fork public machines

When viewing somebody else’s machine, you can make changes to the machine, but your changes won’t be saved. You can fork the machine to create an editable copy inside your **My Projects**.

### Export a public machine

1. Open the left drawer menu to show the **Machines** list.
2. Choose **Export code** from the <MoreHorizontal size={18} /> triple dot contextual menu alongside the machine name to open the Export machine dialog.
3. Use the **JSON**, **JavaScript**, or **TypeScript** button to copy the code in your preferred format to your clipboard.
4. Paste into your code editor.
