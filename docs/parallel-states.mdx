title: Parallel states
---

In statecharts, a parallel state is a state that has multiple child states (also known as **regions**) that are all active at the same time. This is different from a [parent state](parent-states.mdx), where only _one_ child state is active at a time.

Parallel states have the following characteristics:

- Entering a parallel state will also simultaneously enter all of its regions.
- Exiting a parallel state will also simultaneously exit all of its regions.
- An event received in a parallel state is simultaneously received & handled by all of its regions.

You can easily visualize and simulate parallel states in Stately’s editor. [Read more about parallel states in Stately’s editor](/docs/editor-states-and-transitions/#parallel-states).

Here is a music player example with a parallel state consisting of two regions, one for handling playing the track and one for handling the volume:

```ts
import { createMachine, assign } from 'xstate';

const playerMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'player',
  // highlight-next-line
  type: 'parallel',
  states: {
    track: {
      initial: 'paused',
      states: {
        paused: {
          on: { PLAY: 'playing' },
        },
        playing: {
          on: { STOP: 'paused' },
        },
      },
    },
    volume: {
      initial: 'normal',
      states: {
        normal: {
          on: { MUTE: 'muted' },
        },
        muted: {
          on: { UNMUTE: 'normal' },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

<EmbedMachine
  name="Video player"

/>

## Parallel state value

The [state value](states.mdx#state-value) of a parallel state is an object with the state values of each of its regions.

```ts
const playerActor = createActor(playerMachine);
playerActor.start();

console.log(playerActor.getSnapshot().value);
// logs the object:
// {
//   track: 'paused',
//   volume: 'normal'
// }
```

## Parallel onDone transition

When all regions of a parallel state have reached their final states, the `onDone` transition of the parallel state is taken.

In this example, the `onDone` transition of the parallel state is taken when both regions have reached their final states; that is, when `'grindingBeans'` reaches the `'grindingBeans.beansGround'` state and `'boilingWater'` reaches the `'boilingWater.waterBoiled'` state.

```ts
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

export const machine = createMachine({
  id: "coffee",
  initial: "preparing",
  states: {
    preparing: {
      states: {
        grindBeans: {
          initial: "grindingBeans",
          states: {
            grindingBeans: {
              on: {
                BEANS_GROUND: {
                  target: "beansGround",
                },
              },
            },
            beansGround: {
              // highlight-next-line
              type: "final",
            },
          },
        },
        boilWater: {
          initial: "boilingWater",
          states: {
            boilingWater: {
              on: {
                WATER_BOILED: {
                  target: "waterBoiled",
                },
              },
            },
            waterBoiled: {
              // highlight-next-line
              type: "final",
            },
          },
        },
      },
      type: "parallel",
      // highlight-start
      onDone: {
        target: "makingCoffee",
      },
      // highlight-end
    },
    makingCoffee: {},
  },
});
```

## Modeling

_Coming soon_

- Avoid transitions between regions
- Used for separation of concerns that _may_ affect each other (i.e. synchronization)
- If completely separate, prefer `invoke` instead


## Parallel states cheatsheet

### Cheatsheet: create a parallel state

```ts
import { createMachine } from "xstate";

const machine = createMachine({
  // ...
  states: {
    type: 'parallel',
    states: {
      one: {/* ... */},
      two: {/* ... */},
      three: {/* ... */}
    },
    onDone: {
      // Taken when all regions have reached their final states
    }
  }
});
```
