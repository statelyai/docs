title: Initial states
---

When a state machine starts, it enters the **initial state** first. A machine can only have one top-level initial state; if there were multiple initial states, the machine wouldn’t know where to start!

In XState, the initial state is defined by the `initial` property on the machine config:

```ts
const feedbackMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'feedback',

  // highlight-start
  // Initial state
  initial: 'prompt',
  // highlight-end

  // Finite states
  states: {
    // highlight-next-line
    prompt: {
      /* ... */
    },
    // ...
  },
});
```

In our video player, paused is the initial state because the video player is paused by default and requires user interaction to start playing.
