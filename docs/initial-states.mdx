title: Initial states
---

When a state machine starts, it enters the **initial state** first. A machine can only have one top-level initial state; if there were multiple initial states, the machine wouldn’t know where to start!

In XState, the initial state is defined by the `initial` property on the machine config:

```ts
const feedbackMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'feedback',

  // highlight-start
  // Initial state
  initial: 'prompt',
  // highlight-end

  // Finite states
  states: {
    // highlight-next-line
    prompt: {
      /* ... */
    },
    // ...
  },
});
```

In our video player, paused is the initial state because the video player is paused by default and requires user interaction to start playing.

In Stately Studio, the filled circle with an arrow icon represents the initial state.
