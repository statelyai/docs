title: Promise actors
---

Promise actors are actors that represent a promise that performs some asynchronous task. They may resolve with some output, or reject with an error.

## Promise actor capabilities

| | Capability | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ❌ | Receive&nbsp;events | Promise actors currently do not receive events. |
| ✅ | Send events | Promise actors can send events to other actors it has reference to, such as those provided in its `input`. |
| ❌ | Spawn actors | Promise actors currently cannot spawn new actors. |
| ✅ | Input | You can provide `input` to promise actors. |
| ✅ | Output | Promise actors can produce `output`, which is the resolved value of the promise. |

## Promise actor logic

You can define promise actor logic using the `fromPromise(...)` actor logic creator, which takes a function that returns a promise and returns actor logic that can be used to create promise actors.

```ts
import { fromPromise, createActor } from 'xstate';

async function getUser(id: string) {
  // ...
  return { id, /* other user data */ };
}

// highlight-start
const promiseLogic = fromPromise(async () => {
  const user = await getUser('123');

  return user;
});
// highlight-end

const promiseActor = createActor(promiseLogic);

promiseActor.subscribe(snapshot => {
  console.log(snapshot.status, snapshot.output);
});

promiseActor.start();

// logs 'active', undefined
// ... (after some time)
// logs 'done', { id: '123', /* other user data */ }
```

## Promise actor input

You can pass in `input` to a promise actor by passing it to the `createActor(...)` function as the `input` property of the second argument. In the promise logic (`fromPromise(promiseFn)`), you read the `input` property of the first argument passed to the promise function:

```ts
import { fromPromise, createActor } from 'xstate';

const promiseLogic = fromPromise(async ({ input }) => {
  const user = await getUser(input.id);

  return user;
});

const promiseActor = createActor(promiseLogic, {
  // highlight-next-line
  input: { id: '123' }
});
```

The `input` type is inferred from the promise function's first argument type. You can also provide an explicit `input` type in the second generic parameter:

```ts
import { fromPromise } from 'xstate';

interface User {
  name: string;
  id: string;
}

const secondLogic = fromPromise(async ({ input }: { input: { id: string }}) => {
  const user = await getUser(input.id); // User is inferred

  return user;
});

const firstLogic = fromPromise<User, { id: string }>(async ({ input, self, /* ... */ }) => {
  const user = await getUser(input.id);

  return user;
});
```

## Promise actor output

To get the eventual resolved `output` of a promise actor, you can subscribe to the promise actor and check the `status` property of the snapshot. If the `status` is `'done'`, you can access the `output` property of the snapshot to get the resolved value. Otherwise, the `output` will be `undefined`.

```ts
import { fromPromise } from 'xstate';

const promiseLogic = fromPromise(async () => {
  const user = await getUser('123');

  return user;
});

const promiseActor = createActor(promiseLogic);

promiseActor.subscribe(snapshot => {
  if (snapshot.status === 'done') {
    console.log(snapshot.output);
    // logs { id: '123', /* other user data */ }
  }
});
```

You can also use `toPromise(...)` to convert any actor, including promise actors, to a promise. This is useful if you want to `await` the `output` of an actor:

```ts
import { toPromise, createActor } from 'xstate';
import { somePromiseLogic } from './somePromiseLogic';

const promiseActor = createActor(somePromiseLogic);
promiseActor.start();

// highlight-next-line
const output = await toPromise(promiseActor);

console.log(output);
// logs the resolved output of the promise actor
```

## Promise actor error handling

If an error occurs in the promise logic, the promise actor will reject with the error. You can subscribe to the promise actor and check the `status` property of the snapshot in an **error observer** (the `error` property of the observer object).

```ts
import { fromPromise } from 'xstate';

const promiseLogic = fromPromise(async () => {
  // ...
  throw new Error('Something went wrong');
});

const promiseActor = createActor(promiseLogic);
promiseActor.subscribe({
  // highlight-start
  error: (error) => {
    console.error(error);
    // logs 'Error: Something went wrong'
  }
    // highlight-end
});

promiseActor.start();
```
