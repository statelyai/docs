States can contain more states, also known as **child states**. These child states are only active when the parent state is active.

Child states are nested inside their parent states.

In the video player above, the *Opened* state is a parent state to the *Playing*, *Paused*, and *Stopped* states. These states, their transitions, and their events are nested inside the *Opened* state.

### How to add a child state

First, select your machine or an existing state where you want to create the child state. Then…

- Use the **+ State** button that appears above the selected state to create a nested child state. Or…
- If a state already contains child states, you can double-click inside the parent state to create another child state.

### How to change the parent state of a child state

Using the **State details** panel:

1. Select the child state you want to reparent.
2. Open the **State details** panel from the right tool menu.
3. Choose your desired new parent from the **Parent** dropdown menu.
