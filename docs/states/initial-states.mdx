title: Initial states

When a state machine starts, it enters the **initial state** first. A machine can only have one top-level initial state; if there were multiple initial states, the machine wouldn’t know where to start!

Watch our [“What are initial states?” video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=goCpmgyrjL0&list=PLvWgkXBB3dd4I_l-djWVU2UGPyBgKfnTQ&index=3) (1m17s).

In our video player, paused is the initial state because the video player is paused by default and requires user interaction to start playing.
