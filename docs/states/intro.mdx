title: States

A state describes the machine’s status or mode, which could be as simple as *Paused* and *Playing*. A state machine can only be in one state at a time.

In the Stately Studio, the rounded rectangle boxes are states. The **!** warning icon in the machine above indicates an unreachable state. The state is unreachable because it isn’t connected to the [initial state](/states/initial-states.mdx) by a [transition](/transitions-and-events/intro.mdx).

:::

These states are “finite”; the machine can only move through the states you’ve pre-defined.

## Create a state

1. Select your machine or an existing state.
2. Create a new state inside your machine or existing state:
   - Use the **+ State** button that appears above the selected state, or:
   - Drag from the handles on the left, right and bottom sides of the selected state, and release to create a connecting transition, event and new state.
   - Double-click inside your machine or an existing state.
