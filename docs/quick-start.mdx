This quick start guide will help you get started with XState and Stately Studio. You will learn how to create a state machine, create an actor from that state machine, send events to that actor, and observe the state changes.

The fastest way to start with Stately Studio is to go to [state.new](https://state.new). There, youâ€™ll find a starter machine with all the statechart basics ready for you to edit. [Read more about Stately Studio](studio.mdx).

## Installing XState V5 beta

[XState](xstate.mdx) is a visual state management and orchestration library for JavaScript and TypeScript.

Install the XState V5 beta using your preferred package manager:


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm install xstate@beta
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm install xstate@beta
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add xstate@beta
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Create a machine

In XState, a machine is an object that contains all the logic for an actor. In this example, we will create a simple toggle machine that can be in one of two states: `Active` or `Inactive`. The `toggle` event will toggle the state between `Active` and `Inactive`.

```js
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const toggleMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'toggle',
  initial: 'Inactive',
  states: {
    Inactive: {
      on: { toggle: 'Active' },
    },
    Active: {
      on: { toggle: 'Inactive' },
    },
  },
});
```

[Read our introduction to state machines and statecharts](state-machines-and-statecharts.mdx) to familiarize yourself with the concepts.

## Create an actor and send events

Machine logic can be used to create an actor. An [actor](actors.mdx) is a running process that can receive messages (events), send messages and change its behavior based on the messages it receives.

```js
import { createMachine, createActor } from 'xstate';

const toggleMachine = createMachine({
  // Machine code from above
});

// Create an actor that you can send events to.
// Note: the actor is not started yet!
const actor = createActor(machine);

// Subscribe to snapshots (emitted state changes) from the actor
actor.subscribe((snapshot) => {
  console.log('Value:', snapshot.value);
});

// Start the actor
actor.start(); // logs 'Inactive'

// Send events
actor.send({ type: 'toggle' }); // logs 'Active'
actor.send({ type: 'toggle' }); // logs 'Inactive'
```

## Use delayed transitions

[Delayed transitions](delayed-transitions.mdx) are transitions that automatically happen after a specified interval of time.

```js
export const toggleMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'toggle',
  initial: 'Inactive',
  states: {
    Inactive: {
      on: { toggle: 'Active' },
    },
    Active: {
      on: { toggle: 'Inactive' },
      after: { 2000: 'Inactive' },
    },
  },
});
```

## Handle context data

[Context](context.mdx) is how you store data in a state machine actor.

```js
import { assign, createMachine } from 'xstate';

export const toggleMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'toggle',
  context: { count: 0 },
  initial: 'Inactive',
  states: {
    Inactive: {
      on: { toggle: 'Active' },
    },
    Active: {
      entry: assign({
        count: ({ context }) => context.count + 1
      }),
      on: { toggle: 'Inactive' },
      after: { 2000: 'Inactive' },
    },
  },
});
```

## Use your machine with a framework

- [Check out all our packages](/docs/category/xstate-packages)
- [Find out more about the `@xstate/react` package](xstate-react.mdx)

```jsx
import { useMachine } from '@xstate/react';
import { toggleMachine } from './toggleMachine';

const App = () => {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(toggleMachine);

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Value: {state.value}</div>
      <button onClick={() => send({ type: 'toggle' })}>
        Toggle
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```
