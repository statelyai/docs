This quick start guide will help you get started with XState and Stately Studio. You will learn how to create a state machine, create an actor from that state machine, send events to that actor, and observe the state changes.

:::studio

The fastest way to start with Stately Studio is to go to [state.new](https://state.new). There, you’ll find a starter machine with all the statechart basics ready for you to edit. [Read more about Stately Studio](studio.mdx).

## Installing XState v5

[XState](xstate.mdx) is a visual state management and orchestration library for JavaScript and TypeScript.

Install the XState v5 using your preferred package manager:


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash
npm install xstate
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm install xstate
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add xstate
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::typescript

**XState v5 requires TypeScript version 5.0 or greater.** 

For best results, use the latest TypeScript version. [Read more about XState and TypeScript](typescript.mdx)

## Create a machine

In XState, a [machine](machines.mdx) is an object that contains all the logic for an [actor](actors.mdx). In this example, we will create a simple toggle machine that can be in one of two states: `Active` or `Inactive`. The `toggle` event will toggle the state between `Active` and `Inactive`.

```js
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const toggleMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'toggle',
  initial: 'Inactive',
  states: {
    Inactive: {
      on: { toggle: 'Active' },
    },
    Active: {
      on: { toggle: 'Inactive' },
    },
  },
});
```

[Read our introduction to state machines and statecharts](state-machines-and-statecharts.mdx) to familiarize yourself with the concepts.

## Create an actor and send events

[Machine logic](/docs/actors#actor-logic) can be used to create an actor. An [actor](actors.mdx) is a running process that can receive messages (events), send messages and change its behavior based on the messages it receives.

```js
import { createMachine, createActor } from 'xstate';

const toggleMachine = createMachine({
  // Machine code from above
});

// Create an actor that you can send events to.
// Note: the actor is not started yet!
const actor = createActor(machine);

// Subscribe to snapshots (emitted state changes) from the actor
actor.subscribe((snapshot) => {
  console.log('Value:', snapshot.value);
});

// Start the actor
actor.start(); // logs 'Inactive'

// Send events
actor.send({ type: 'toggle' }); // logs 'Active'
actor.send({ type: 'toggle' }); // logs 'Inactive'
```

## Use delayed transitions

[Delayed transitions](delayed-transitions.mdx) are transitions that automatically happen after a specified interval of time.

```js
export const toggleMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'toggle',
  initial: 'Inactive',
  states: {
    Inactive: {
      on: { toggle: 'Active' },
    },
    Active: {
      on: { toggle: 'Inactive' },
      after: { 2000: 'Inactive' },
    },
  },
});
```

## Handle context data

[Context](context.mdx) is how you store data in a state machine actor.

```js
import { assign, createMachine } from 'xstate';

export const toggleMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'toggle',
  context: { count: 0 },
  initial: 'Inactive',
  states: {
    Inactive: {
      on: { toggle: 'Active' },
    },
    Active: {
      entry: assign({
        count: ({ context }) => context.count + 1
      }),
      on: { toggle: 'Inactive' },
      after: { 2000: 'Inactive' },
    },
  },
});
```

## Use your machine with a framework

- [Check out all our packages](/docs/category/xstate-packages)
- [Find out more about the `@xstate/react` package](xstate-react.mdx)

```jsx
import { useMachine } from '@xstate/react';
import { toggleMachine } from './toggleMachine';

const App = () => {
  const [state, send] = useMachine(toggleMachine);

  return (
    <div>
      <div>Value: {state.value}</div>
      <button onClick={() => send({ type: 'toggle' })}>
        Toggle
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```
