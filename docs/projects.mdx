A project is a collection of machines that helps you organize your personal machines and collaborate with others on your application logic.

You can access your projects from **My Projects** at the left of the top bar when you’re signed in to Stately Studio. **My Projects** lists your personal projects and is one of the locations where you can create new projects.

When you select a project, the first machine in the project will open in the editor. The other machines in your project are accessible from the **Machines** list in the left drawer menu.

### Shared projects

Shared projects are available to [Teams](teams.mdx). Team projects are listed inside their Team in the Stately Studio workspace.
