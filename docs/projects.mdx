A project is a collection of machines that helps you organize your personal machines and collaborate with others on your application logic.

You can access your projects from **My Projects** at the left of Stately Studio’s top bar when you’re signed into Stately Studio. **My Projects** lists your personal projects and is one of the locations where you can create new projects.

When you select a project, the first machine in the project will open in Stately Studio’s editor. The other machines in your project are accessible from the **Machines** list in the left drawer menu.

### Change a project’s visibility

A project can be **public**, **unlisted**, or **private**. If the project is a shared team project, only team members with the **Owner** or **Admin** roles can change its visibility.

- Public projects are visible to everyone. They are discoverable on the [Discover](discover.mdx) page and listed on your profile page.
- Unlisted projects are visible to everyone with the project’s URL but are not findable on the Discover page or listed on your profile page.
- Private projects are only visible to you and the team that owns the project.

1. Use the **Share** button in Stately Studio’s top bar to open the Share dialog.
2. Toggle the project’s visibility between **public**, **unlisted**, or **private** from the dropdown menu in the Share dialog.
