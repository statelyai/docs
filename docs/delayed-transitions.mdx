title: Delayed (after) transitions
---

**Delayed transitions** are transitions that only happen after a set amount of time. Delayed transitions are handy for building timeouts and intervals into your application logic. If another event occurs before the end of the timer, the transition doesn’t complete.

Delayed transitions are defined on the `after` property in milliseconds. They are often referred to as “after” transitions.

You can easily visualize and simulate delayed transitions in Stately’s editor. [Read more about delayed transitions in Stately’s editor](/docs/editor-states-and-transitions/#delayed-after-transitions).

```ts
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const pushTheButtonGame = createMachine({
  initial: 'waitingForButtonPush',
  states: {
    waitingForButtonPush: {
      // highlight-start
      after: {
        5000: {
          target: 'timedOut',
          actions: 'logThatYouGotTimedOut',
        },
      },
      // highlight-end
      on: {
        PUSH_BUTTON: {
          actions: 'logSuccess',
          target: 'success',
        },
      },
    },
    success: {},
    timedOut: {},
  },
});
```

In a video player, want the video to be *Closed* out of fullscreen mode a few seconds after the video has *Stopped*, instead of closing the fullscreen mode suddenly as soon as the video is stopped. The eventless transition above transitions from the *Stopped* state to the *Closed* state after 5 seconds.

## Delays

You can define delays in a few ways: [inlined](#inlined-delays), [referenced](#referenced-delays), and [as an expression](#delay-expressions).

### Inlined delays

You can define an inlined delay by specifying the delay time (in milliseconds) directly:

```ts
const machine = createMachine({
  initial: 'idle',
  states: {
    idle: {
      after: {
        1000: { target: 'nextState' },
      },
    },
    nextState: {},
  },
});
```

This will transition to the `nextState` state after 1000ms.

### Referenced delays

You can also define referenced delays by specifying a string delay key, and providing the actual delay time separately.

For example:

```ts
const machine = createMachine(
  {
    initial: 'idle',
    states: {
      idle: {
        after: {
          timeout: { target: 'nextState' },
        },
      },
      nextState: {},
    },
  },
  {
    // highlight-start
    delays: {
      timeout: 1000,
    },
    // highlight-end
  },
);
```

### Delay expressions

The delay option can be evaluated as a delay expression. The delay expression function takes in an object that contains `context` and `event` properties and returns the resolved `delay` (in milliseconds).

```ts
`after: [{ delay: () => 1000, target: ... }]`;
```

## Lifecycle

Delayed transition timers are canceled when the state is exited.

## Testing

- Simulated clock

## TypeScript

You can strongly type the `delays` of your machine in the `types.delays` property of the machine config.

```ts
const machine = createMachine({
  types: {} as {
    // highlight-start
    delays: 'shortTimeout' | 'longTimeout' | 'eventually';
    // highlight-end
    // ...
  },
  // ...
  after: {
    // Autocompleted
    shortTimeout: {
      /* ... */
    },
  },
  on: {
    someEvent: {
      actions: raise(
        { type: 'anotherEvent' },
        {
          // Autocompleted
          delay: 'eventually',
        },
      ),
    },
  },
});
```

## Cheatsheet

Use our XState delayed transitions cheatsheet below to get started quickly.

```ts
createMachine({
  after: {
    DELAY: {
      /* ... */
    },
  },
}).provide({
  delays: {
    DELAY: 1000, // or expression
  },
});
```
