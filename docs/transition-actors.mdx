title: Transition Actors
---

Transition actors are actors whose logic is represented by a **state-transition function**, which is a function that returns the **next state** of an actor given:

- The **current state** of the actor
- The **event** that triggered the transition

This is very similar to a _reducer function_ in libraries like Redux.

## Transition actor capabilities

| | Capability | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ✅ | Receive&nbsp;events | Transition actors receive events to modify its state. |
| ✅ | Send events | Transition actors can send events to other actors it has reference to, such as those provided in its `input`. Note that doing this would be _impure_. |
| ❌ | Spawn actors | Transition actors currently cannot spawn new actors. |
| ✅ | Input | You can provide `input` to transition actors. |
| ❌ | Output | Transition actors currently do not produce output – they are active indefinitely until they are stopped or an error occurs. |

## Transition actor logic

You can define transition actor logic using the `fromTransition(...)` actor logic creator, which takes two arguments:

- A **state-transition function** that returns the next state of the actor
- An **initial state** for the actor

The actor logic creator returns actor logic that can be used to create transition actors.

```ts
import { fromTransition, createActor } from 'xstate';

const countLogic = fromTransition((state, event) => {
  switch (event.type) {
    case 'increment': {
      return { count: state.count + 1 };
    }
    case 'decrement': {
      return { count: state.count - 1 };
    }
    default: {
      return state;
    }
  }
}, { count: 0 }); // Initial state

const countActor = createActor(countLogic);
countActor.subscribe(snapshot => {
  console.log(snapshot.context);
});
countActor.start();
// logs { count: 0 }

countActor.send({ type: 'increment' });
// logs { count: 1 }

countActor.send({ type: 'decrement' });
// logs { count: 0 }
```

## Transition actor input

You can pass in `input` to a transition actor, which will be passed to the function that resolves the initial state.

```ts
import { fromTransition, createActor } from 'xstate';

const countLogic = fromTransition((state, event) => {
  // ...
// highlight-start
}, ({ input }: { input: number }) => ({
  count: input  // Initial state
}));
// highlight-end

const countActor = createActor(countLogic, {
  // highlight-next-line
  input: 42
});

countActor.subscribe(snapshot => {
  console.log(snapshot.context);
  // logs { count: 42 }
});

countActor.start();
```
