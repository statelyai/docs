## API

```ts
actions: assign({
  ref: ({ spawn }) => spawn(fromPromise(...), {
    id: 'some-id',
  })
})
```

- `spawn(actorBehavior, options?)`
  - `actorBehavior` - The behavior of the actor to spawn. This can be a function, promise, observable, or callback.
  - `options` - Options for spawning the actor.
    - `id` - The ID of the actor. This is used to reference the actor in the state machine.
    - `input`

## Source

- Inline: `spawn(fromPromise(...))`
- Referenced: `spawn('getUser')`
  - `.provide({ actors })`

## Lifecycle

- Created & started when spawned
- Stopped when the machine is stopped
- Can be manually stopped

## Stopping an actor

- `actions: stop('some-id')`

- Note this does not clear it from the `context`
