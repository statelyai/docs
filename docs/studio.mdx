Stately Studio is a suite of tools for building app logic, including the Editor, [developer tools for XState](developer-tools.mdx), and much more coming soon.

You can use [Stately Studio’s editor](/studio.mdx#stately-studios-editor) to model your logic using state machines and statecharts visually; no code required! Collaborate on your machines with coworkers and friends with [shared projects in teams](/#projects-and-teams). Use the [XState VS Code extension](xstate-vscode-extension.mdx) to use the editor with your codebase inside your code editor, or [export](/#export) your code from Stately Studio into your codebase.

What are state machines and statecharts? We’re glad you asked! [Check out our no-code introduction to state machines and statecharts](state-machines-and-statecharts.mdx).

## Stately Studio’s editor

Stately Studio’s editor supports everything you need to visually build state machines and statecharts. The editor currently has two modes; [**Design** mode](design-mode.mdx) for creating your machines and [**Simulate** mode](simulate-mode.mdx) for simulating how your machine works.

[Learn how to use Stately in our quick introduction video (7m36s)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzYIerEutgk).

### Quick start tutorials

You can access quick start tutorials from the blue <HelpCircle size={12} /> Help button in the editor.

When you first visit the Editor, you’ll be shown two short videos (7m36s) as a quick start guide. You can access these videos again anytime from:

- Editor menu > Help > <GraduationCap size={12} /> **Learn Stately**.
- The <HelpCircle size={12} /> Help button > <GraduationCap size={12} /> **Learn Stately**.
