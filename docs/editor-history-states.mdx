title: History states in Stately’s editor
---

A [history state](history-states.mdx) is a special type of state (a _pseudostate_) that remembers the last [child state](parent-states.mdx) that was active before its parent state is exited. When a transition from outside the parent state targets a history state, the remembered child state is entered.

## Make a state a history state

First, select the state you want to set as a history state for the parent state. Then…

### On the canvas

1. Right-click the state to open the edit menu.
2. From the **Type** options, choose **History**.

### Using the state Details panel

1. Select the state you want to make a history state.
2. Open the state <Info size={18} /> **Details** panel from the right tool menu.
3. From the type option, choose **History**.

To set the state back as a normal state, follow the same steps and select the **Normal** type option.
