# Actions and actors

While the statechart is running, it can execute other effects called actions. You can fire an action upon entry or exit of a state. Actions are “fire-and-forget effects”; once the machine has fired the action, it moves on and forgets the action. You can also fire actions on transitions. [Read more about actions](actions.mdx).

State machines can invoke actors as longer-running processes that can receive events, send events, and change their behavior based on the events they receive. You can invoke actors on entry to a state and stop on exit. [Read more about actors](actors.mdx).

## Add actions

- Select a state and use <Plus size={18} /> **Entry action** or **Exit action**.
- Select a transition and use <Plus size={18} /> **Action**.
- Select a state or transition, open the <Info size={18} /> **Details** panel from the right tool menu, and use the <Plus size={18} /> **Effect** or <Plus size={18} /> **Action**  button and choose **Add entry action**, **Add exit action**, or **Add action**.

Use the <Edit size={18} /> edit icon button to open the **Action** panel and add custom action parameters. Actions are created as custom actions by default, but you can also use [XState built-in actions](#xstate-built-in-actions).

To remove an action, use the <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key, *right-click* and choose **Delete**, or use the <Trash size={18} /> delete icon button in the **Details** panel.

### XState built-in actions

You can choose from the following built-in XState actions, which will be formatted in your [exported code](export-as-code.mdx). The options are:

- [assign](/docs/actions/#assign-action): assigns data to the state context.
- [raise](/docs/actions/#raise-action): raises an event that is received by the same machine.
- [log](/docs/actions/#log-action): an easy way to log messages to the console.
- [sendTo](/docs/actions/#send-to-action): sends an event to a specific actor.
- [stop](/docs/actions/#stop-action): stops a child actor.

To add a built-in action, first [add an action](#add-actions). [Read more about actions in XState](actions.mdx).

## Add invoked actors

You can invoke multiple actors on a single state. Top-level final states cannot have invoked actors. [Read more about invoking actors](invoke.mdx).

  name="video player"
/>

In the video player above, the *startVideo* actor is invoked when the video player is in the *Opened* state.

### Invoke actors on a state

- Select a state and use <PlayCircle size={18} /> **Invoke**.
- Select a state, open the state <Info size={18} /> **Details** panel from the right tool menu, and use the <Plus size={18} /> **Effect** button and choose **Add invoked actor**.

Use the <Edit size={18} /> edit icon button to open the **Invoked actor** panel and enter the actor’s source logic and ID. The ID can be used with the [`sendTo` or `stop` actions](#xstate-built-in-actions) to stop and send events to the actor.

To remove an actor, use the <kbd>Backspace</kbd> key, *right-click* and choose **Delete**, or use the <Trash size={18} /> delete icon button in the **Details** panel.

#### Invoke done and invoke error events

**Invoke done events** and **invoke error events** transition from a state once its invocation has been completed or returns an error. The source state must have an invoked actor to create an invoke done or invoke error event.

- Select the state with an invoked actor and create a new transition from that state. The first new transition will be created as an invoke done event. 
- Subsequent new transitions will be created as invoke error events.

To change an invoke done or invoke error event back into a regular transition, Use the <MoreHorizontal size={18} /> triple dot menu or *right-click* the transition, and from **Event type**, choose **Always**.
