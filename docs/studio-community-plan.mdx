# Stately Studio Community Plan

**Stately Studio will always be free to our Community users** on this free plan, and we will make many future features available on every plan. Request features and check out what we’ve got planned on [our roadmap](https://feedback.stately.ai).

We offer a **7-day free trial** on the Stately Studio [Pro](studio-pro-plan.mdx), [Team](studio-team-plan.mdx), or [Enterprise](studio-enterprise-plan.mdx) plans so you can explore how our paid features work for you and your team. You can [upgrade](/upgrade.mdx) when you’re signed into Stately Studio.
