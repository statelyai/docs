# Stately Studio Community Plan

**Stately Studio will always be free to our Community users** on this free plan, and we will make many future features available on every plan. Request features and check out what we’ve got planned on [our roadmap](https://statelyai.canny.ai).

We offer a **7-day free trial** on the [Stately Studio Pro account](/studio-pro-plan.mdx) or the [Stately Studio Team account](/studio-team-plan.mdx) so you can explore how our Pro and Team features work for you and your team. You can [upgrade](/upgrade.mdx) when you’re signed into Stately Studio.
