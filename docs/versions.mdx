# Version history

Version history is helpful if you want to save checkpoints while modeling machines or mirror version changes in the rest of your codebase. Users on our Pro plan and team members can view and create versions for machines in team projects and their own machines in **My Projects**. [Read more about team roles and versions](#team-roles-and-versions).

Each machine has a version history with at least one initial version. An initial version is created when a new machine is created or imported. Different versions can be saved from the current machine using the **Version history** panel in the right tool menu when in **Edit** mode.

:::studio

Version history is a Pro feature of the Stately Studio. [Check out the features on our Pro plan](/studio-pro-plan.mdx) or [upgrade to try the Pro plan with a 30-day free trial](https://stately.ai/registry/billing).

## Save a version

You can save a new version of your machine when in **Edit** mode.

1. Open the **Version history** panel from the right tool menu.
2. The **Current version** of the machine is selected by default. Use the **Save** button to create a new version from your current machine. 

:::tip

The **Save** button will be disabled unless you have changed your machine since you created the latest version.

:::

Versions are named with their creation time by default and have the version creator’s avatar.

### Initial versions

An initial version is created when a new machine is created or imported. For newer machines, the initial version is named “Initial version.” The initial version’s name for older machines is a timestamp of when the machine was created or imported. Machines created in 2022 may not have an initial version as they were made before the version history existed.

### Rename a version

You can rename any version to something other than the version’s timestamp.

1. Select the version name to reveal the text input.
2. Enter the version’s new name.
3. The new name will be autosaved when you hit enter or navigate away from the text input.

<!-- TODO: ![Selecting a version name in the Version history panel, showing the text input for the new name.]() -->

The version’s timestamp will still be shown under the version name.

## View a version

You can view any version by selecting that version in the **Version history**. The version will be shown in the Editor and read-only unless you restore that version using the **Restore** button.

<!-- TODO: ![A version previewed in the Editor.]() -->

You can return to viewing the current version of your machine from **Return to current version** in the top bar or by selecting **Current Version** from the **Version history** in the right tool menu.

## Restore a version

You can restore your current machine to any version from the version history.

:::tip

If you restore a version without creating a new version for your current machine, your current machine will be autosaved in your version history. These autosaved machine names start with “Pre-restore” and have a Stately Bot icon instead of your avatar.

<!-- TODO: ![Autosave machine in the Version history panel.]() -->

### Restore a version from the **Version history** panel

1. Open the **Version history** panel from the right tool menu.
2. Hover over the version you want to restore to reveal the restore icon button.
3. Use the restore icon button to restore to your chosen version.

<!-- TODO: ![Version history panel with the restore icon revealed]() -->

### Restore a version when viewing a version 

When [viewing a version](#view-a-version), you can restore to that version using the **Restore** button in the top bar.

<!-- TODO: ![A version previewed in the Editor with an arrow pointing to the Restore button.]() -->

## Create a new machine from a version

You can also create a new machine from a version in your version history.

1. Open the **Version history** panel from the right tool menu.
2. Select the version from which you want to create a new machine. The version will be previewed in the Editor.
3. Use the copy icon button in the top bar to create a new machine from that version.

<!-- TODO: ![A version previewed in the Editor with an arrow pointing to the Copy button.]() -->

Your new machine will be created and opened in the same project with the same name appended with “(copy).”

## Delete a version

1. Open the **Version history** panel from the right tool menu.
2. Select the version you want to delete. The version will be previewed in the Editor.
3. Use the delete icon button in the top bar to delete that version.
4. The current version will then be opened in the Editor.

<!-- TODO: ![A version previewed in the Editor with an arrow pointing to the Delete button.]() -->

## Team roles and versions

Team viewers can only create new versions of machines in their team’s projects. Team owners, admins, and editors can view, create, restore, and delete versions of a team project’s machine.
