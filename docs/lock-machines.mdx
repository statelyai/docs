You can lock a machine anytime to prevent accidental edits. Locked machines have a <Lock size={18} /> **Locked** status displayed in the editor’s top bar. 

Hover over the <Lock size={18} /> **Locked** text to view who locked the machine and when.

Locking machines is a Pro feature of the Studio. [Check out the features on our Pro plan](/studio-pro-plan.mdx) or [upgrade to try the Pro plan with a 30-day free trial](https://stately.ai/registry/billing).

:::

Locking a machine prevents you, or anyone else on your team, from the following:

- Editing the machine
- Delete the machine
- Rename the machine
- [Import code](import-from-code.mdx) to replace the machine

If somebody else is viewing or editing the machine when it is locked, their changes will not be saved, and they will be notified that the machine is now locked.

## How to lock and unlock a machine

From the editor menu, go to **Machine** > <Unlock size={18} /> **Lock machine** / <Lock size={18} /> **Unlock machine**.

From the machine’s <Info size={18} /> **Details** panel, use the <Unlock size={18} /> Lock machine / <Lock size={18} /> Unlock machine icon button.
