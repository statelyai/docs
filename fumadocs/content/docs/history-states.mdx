title: History states
---

A history state is a special type of state (a _pseudostate_) that remembers the last [child state](parent-states.mdx) that was active before its parent state is exited. When a transition from outside the parent state targets a history state, the remembered child state is entered.

This allows machines to "remember" where they left off when exiting and reentering a parent state.

- If no child state remembered, history goes to `.target` state, if it is specified
- Otherwise, go to [initial state](initial-states.mdx)

A history state returns the parent state to its most recently active child state. The box with an **H** inside represents the history state.

The history state can be deep or shallow:

- A shallow history state remembers the immediate childâ€™s state.
- A deep history state remembers the deepest active state or states inside its child states.

```ts
const checkoutMachine = createMachine({
  // ...
  states: {
    payment: {
      initial: 'card',
      states: {
        card: {},
        paypal: {},
        // highlight-next-line
        hist: { type: 'history' },
      },
    },
    address: {
      on: {
        back: {
          target: 'payment.hist',
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## Shallow vs. deep history

- Shallow history states only remember the last active direct child state.
- Deep history states remember all active descendant states.

## History target

- Normally, history states target the most recent child state of its parent state
- If the history state is entered but the parent state was never visited, the parent's initial state is entered.
- However, you can add a `target: 'childKey'` to specify the default child state that should be entered

## History states cheatsheet

### Cheatsheet: create a history state (shallow by default)

```ts
const machine = createMachine({
  // ...
  states: {
    hist: { type: 'history' },
    firstState: {},
    someState: {},
    anotherState: {},
  },
});
```

### Cheatsheet: create a deep history state

```ts
const machine = createMachine({
  // ...
  states: {
    hist: {
      type: 'history',
      history: 'deep',
    },
    firstState: {},
    someState: {},
    anotherState: {},
  },
});
```

### Cheatsheet: create a history state with a target

```ts
const machine = createMachine({
  // ...
  initialState: 'firstState',
  states: {
    hist: {
      type: 'history',
      target: 'someState',
    },
    firstState: {},
    someState: {},
    anotherState: {},
  },
});
```
