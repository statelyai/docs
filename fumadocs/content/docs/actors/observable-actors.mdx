Observable actors are actors that represent an observable stream of values. This makes it easy to interop with observable libraries like RxJS.

All XState actors are observable.

## Observable actor capabilities

|     | Capability          | Notes                                                                                                                                   |
| --- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ❌  | Receive&nbsp;events | Observable actors do not currently receive events.                                                                                      |
| ✅  | Send events         | Observable actors can send events to other actors it has reference to, such as those provided in its `input`.                           |
| ❌  | Spawn actors        | Observable actors currently cannot spawn new actors.                                                                                    |
| ✅  | Input               | You can provide `input` to observable actors.                                                                                           |
| ❌  | Output              | Observable actors currently do not produce output – they are active indefinitely until they are stopped, completed, or an error occurs. |

## Observable actor logic

You can define observable actor logic using the `fromObservable(...)` actor logic creator, which takes a function that returns an observable and returns actor logic that can be used to create observable actors.

```ts
import { fromObservable, createActor } from 'xstate';
import { interval } from 'rxjs';

[!code highlight:1]
const intervalLogic = fromObservable(() => interval(1000));

const intervalActor = createActor(intervalLogic);
intervalActor.subscribe((snapshot) => {
  console.log(snapshot.context);
});

intervalActor.start();
// logs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...
// every second
```

## Observable actor input

You can pass in `input` to an observable actor by passing it to the `createActor(...)` function as the `input` property of the second argument. In the observable logic (`fromObservable(observableFn)`), you read the `input` property of the first argument passed to the observable function:

```ts
import { fromObservable, createActor } from 'xstate';
import { interval } from 'rxjs';

[!code highlight:1]
const intervalLogic = fromObservable(({ input }) => interval(input.interval));

const intervalActor = createActor(intervalLogic, {
  // [!code highlight:1]
  input: { interval: 10_000 },
});
intervalActor.subscribe((snapshot) => {
  console.log(snapshot.context);
});

intervalActor.start();
// logs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, ...
// every 10 seconds
```
