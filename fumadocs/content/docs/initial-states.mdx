title: Initial states
---

When a state machine starts, it enters the **initial state** first. A machine can only have one top-level initial state; if there were multiple initial states, the machine wouldn’t know where to start!

In XState, the initial state is defined by the `initial` property on the machine config:

```ts
const feedbackMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'feedback',

  // highlight-start
  // Initial state
  initial: 'prompt',
  // highlight-end

  // Finite states
  states: {
    // highlight-next-line
    prompt: {
      /* ... */
    },
    // ...
  },
});
```

In our video player, paused is the initial state because the video player is paused by default and requires user interaction to start playing.

## Specifying an initial state

Typically, a state machine will have multiple [finite states](finite-states.mdx) that it can be in. The `initial` property on the machine config specifies the initial state that the machine should start in.

[Parent states](parent-states.mdx) also must specify an initial state in their `initial` property. The following `trafficLightMachine` will start in the `'green'` state, as it is specified in the `initial` property of the machine config.

When the machine reaches the `'red'` parent state, it will also be in the `'red.walk'` state, as it is specified in the `initial` property of the `'red'` state.

```ts
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const trafficLightMachine = createMachine({
  // highlight-next-line
  initial: 'green',
  states: {
    green: {
      /* ... */
    },
    yellow: {
      /* ... */
    },
    red: {
      // highlight-next-line
      initial: 'walk',
      states: {
        walk: {
          /* ... */
        },
        wait: {
          /* ... */
        },
        stop: {
          /* ... */
        },
      },
    },
  },
});

const trafficLightActor = createActor(trafficLightMachine);

trafficLightActor.subscribe((state) => {
  console.log(state.value);
});

trafficLightActor.start();
// logs 'green'
```
