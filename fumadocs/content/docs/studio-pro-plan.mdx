### Pro features as a team member

If you are a team member of another user’s [team](teams.mdx), with the role of [Admin](/docs/teams/#admin-role) or [Editor](/docs/teams/#editor-role), you also have access to [premium features](#pro-features)! However, if you want to create your own teams, you need to [upgrade to your own Team subscription](upgrade.mdx).
