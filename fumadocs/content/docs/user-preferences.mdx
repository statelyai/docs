We have some simple user preferences to help you customize Stately Studio to fit your needs.

## Light mode and dark mode

You can choose whether you prefer light mode or dark mode, and Stately Studio will remember your setting. You must be signed in to choose your preferred mode.

### Switch between light and dark mode

We plan to set light mode and dark mode according to your operating system preferences in the future. Please [upvote this feature in our roadmap](https://feedback.stately.ai/editor/p/automatic-lightdark-mode-based-on-system-preferences) if itâ€™s a priority for you.

## Translucency

Events are translucent in the Stately Studio canvas to make it easier to distinguish overlapping events and transitions. You can choose to turn translucency off if you prefer.

### Enable and disable translucency

1. Use your avatar button in the top right of Stately Studio to open the user menu.
2. Use the setting to either <Sparkle size={18}/> **Disable translucency** or <Sparkle size={18}/> **Enable translucency**.

Translucency is not yet supported in Safari.
