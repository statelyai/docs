title: Generate with AI
---

**Generate with AI** is an experimental feature that helps you auto-create machines from text descriptions. You can generate a flow for a new machine or use the flow description to describe how you want to modify your current flow.

:::tip

Community users can try generate flow with a limited number of generations each month. [Upgrade your existing plan](https://stately.ai/registry/billing) to get many more generations.

**Generate with AI** is a premium feature of Stately Studio. You can try Stately Studio’s premium plans with a free trial. [Check out the features on our Pro plan](studio-pro-plan.mdx), [Team plan](studio-team-plan.mdx), [Enterprise plan](studio-enterprise-plan.mdx) or [upgrade your existing plan](https://stately.ai/registry/billing).

:::

You have a limited number of generations available to use each month. The number of available generations is reset at the beginning of each calendar month.

There are many reasons you might want to generate your flows, including:

- You have a complex machine in mind and want to get started quickly
- You want an example of a state machine for a particular flow
- You’re new and want to get an idea of how you can model state machines

## Generate a new flow

Generating a new flow will overwrite your current machine with an all-new flow created from your text description.

1. Choose <Sparkles size={18} /> **Generate with AI** when creating a new machine or use the <Sparkles size={18} /> sparkles icon button in the canvas tools to open the generate flow dialog.
2. Enter a text description of the flow you want to generate in as much detail as possible, and use the **Generate** button to generate your flow.

When you generate an all-new flow, only your prompt text is sent to OpenAI.

## Generate from current flow

1. Use the <Sparkles size={18} /> sparkles icon button in the canvas tools to open the generate flow dialog.
2. Ensure **Generate from current flow** is selected to modify your current machine.
3. Enter a text description of the flow you want to generate in as much detail as possible, and use the **Generate** button to generate your flow.

When you use **Generate from current flow**, we share your machine definition with OpenAI to help build the response.

## View history

You can view a history of text descriptions used to generate flows for the current machine. Use the **View history** button inside the **Generate flow** dialog to find your **Prompt history**.

- Use **Open flow** to preview the [version](versions.mdx) of the machine generated from the selected prompt.
- Use **Copy to prompt** to copy the selected prompt into the text description area of the **Generate flow** dialog.

A new [version](versions.mdx) is auto-saved every time you generate a flow. Use the <History size={18} /> **Versions** panel and switch the **Show auto-saved versions** toggle on to browse auto-saved versions of your current machine.
