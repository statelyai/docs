You can highlight your machine’s state and event nodes with colors. You can use colors however you like; some ideas include:

- Color coding groups or types of states or events
- Emphasizing success or error states
- Making your machines match your brand

A note on accessibility: not everyone perceives color the same way, and as many as 8% of men and 0.5% of women are [color blind](https://www.nei.nih.gov/learn-about-eye-health/eye-conditions-and-diseases/color-blindness). Ensure your statecharts are inclusive by using color to emphasize or decorate your machines and [do not use color as the only way to convey information](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/use-of-color.html).

## Change the color of a state or event

All states and events have a default color. In dark mode, the default color is grey. In light mode, the default color is white.

When you hover over the color options, a preview of the color will be shown on the selected state or event.

Colors are faded out in Simulate mode to make the current state and possible events easier to distinguish.
