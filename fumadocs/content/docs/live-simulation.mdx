# Live simulation mode

Live simulation mode helps you share your simulated machine with your team without screen sharing or screenshots. Share the generated live simulation link, and your team can view your simulation in real-time and even trigger events themselves.

## Simulate your machine with others

You must be signed in to start a live simulation. Enter **Simulate** mode from the <Play size={18}/> **Simulate** button.

:::tip

When you’re in **Simulate** mode, your current state and next available events are highlighted in blue to simulate the flow of your machine. Click the available events to transition through states and review your logic.

:::

Use the **Live mode** <Triangle size={18}/> button in the bottom left corner to reveal the **Live simulation** options and choose **Start a live simulation** to start a live simulation session.

When your machine is in live simulation mode, the **Live simulation panel** will display in the bottom left corner with a six-character unique code (for example: 3KNYII) along with **Copy link** and **Stop** buttons. The current state and next events will also be highlighted in orange.

Share your live simulation session with whoever you want using the link or unique session code.
