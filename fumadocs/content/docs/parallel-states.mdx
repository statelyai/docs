title: Parallel states
---

In statecharts, a parallel state is a state that has multiple child states (also known as **regions**) that are all active at the same time. This is different from a [parent state](parent-states.mdx), where only _one_ child state is active at a time.

Parallel states have the following characteristics:

- Entering a parallel state will also simultaneously enter all of its regions.
- Exiting a parallel state will also simultaneously exit all of its regions.
- An event received in a parallel state is simultaneously received & handled by all of its regions.

You can easily visualize and simulate parallel states in Stately's editor. [Read more about parallel states in Stately's editor](/docs/editor-states-and-transitions/#parallel-states).

Here is a music player example with a parallel state consisting of two regions, one for handling playing the track and one for handling the volume:

```ts
import { createMachine, assign } from 'xstate';

const playerMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'player',
  // highlight-next-line
  type: 'parallel',
  states: {
    track: {
      initial: 'paused',
      states: {
        paused: {
          on: { PLAY: 'playing' },
        },
        playing: {
          on: { STOP: 'paused' },
        },
      },
    },
    volume: {
      initial: 'normal',
      states: {
        normal: {
          on: { MUTE: 'muted' },
        },
        muted: {
          on: { UNMUTE: 'normal' },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

## Parallel state value

The [state value](states.mdx#state-value) of a parallel state is an object with the state values of each of its regions.

```ts
const playerActor = createActor(playerMachine);
playerActor.start();

console.log(playerActor.getSnapshot().value);
// logs the object:
// {
//   track: 'paused',
//   volume: 'normal'
// }
```

## Parallel onDone transition

When all regions of a parallel state have reached their final states, the `onDone` transition of the parallel state is taken.

In this example, the `onDone` transition of the parallel state is taken when both regions have reached their final states; that is, when `'grindingBeans'` reaches the `'grindingBeans.beansGround'` state and `'boilingWater'` reaches the `'boilingWater.waterBoiled'` state.

```ts
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

export const machine = createMachine({
  id: 'coffee',
  initial: 'preparing',
  states: {
    preparing: {
      states: {
        grindBeans: {
          initial: 'grindingBeans',
          states: {
            grindingBeans: {
              on: {
                BEANS_GROUND: {
                  target: 'beansGround',
                },
              },
            },
            beansGround: {
              // highlight-next-line
              type: 'final',
            },
          },
        },
        boilWater: {
          initial: 'boilingWater',
          states: {
            boilingWater: {
              on: {
                WATER_BOILED: {
                  target: 'waterBoiled',
                },
              },
            },
            waterBoiled: {
              // highlight-next-line
              type: 'final',
            },
          },
        },
      },
      type: 'parallel',
      // highlight-start
      onDone: {
        target: 'makingCoffee',
      },
      // highlight-end
    },
    makingCoffee: {},
  },
});
```

## Modeling

When modeling with parallel states, there are several important considerations to keep in mind:

### Best Practices

- **Avoid transitions between regions**: Each region in a parallel state should be independent and not directly transition to states in other regions. This maintains the separation of concerns and prevents complex interdependencies.

- **Use for related concerns**: Parallel states are ideal for modeling aspects of a system that are related but operate independently. For example:

  - A media player's playback state and volume control
  - A form's validation state and submission state
  - A game's player state and game state

- **Consider synchronization**: While regions operate independently, they may need to coordinate. Use events that can be handled by multiple regions to achieve synchronization when needed.

### When to Use Parallel States

- When you have multiple independent aspects of your system that need to be tracked simultaneously
- When these aspects may need to coordinate or affect each other
- When the system needs to maintain multiple active states at once

### When to Use Alternatives

- **Use `invoke` instead** when the concerns are completely separate and don't need to coordinate
- **Use nested states** when the states are hierarchical and only one should be active at a time
- **Use a single state** with multiple properties when the aspects are tightly coupled

### Example Use Cases

- **User Interface**: Managing multiple independent UI states (e.g., sidebar, modal, and main content)
- **Game Development**: Tracking player state, game state, and UI state simultaneously
- **Form Handling**: Managing validation, submission, and error states in parallel
- **Media Players**: Controlling playback, volume, and playlist states independently

## Parallel states cheatsheet

### Cheatsheet: create a parallel state

```ts
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const machine = createMachine({
  // ...
  states: {
    type: 'parallel',
    states: {
      one: {
        /* ... */
      },
      two: {
        /* ... */
      },
      three: {
        /* ... */
      },
    },
    onDone: {
      // Taken when all regions have reached their final states
    },
  },
});
```
