You can now export your state machines to Mermaid code and diagrams! [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org) is a JavaScript-based diagramming and charting tool that renders Markdown-inspired text definitions.

Mermaid is a useful format because Mermaid diagrams are created using plain text and can be easily version-controlled and shared with others. [GitHub supports Mermaid as an advanced format](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams) for issues, discussions, pull requests, wikis, and Markdown files.

Find the **Mermaid** export in Stately from the dropdown menu in the **Code** panel. You can export as Mermaid-formatted code, preview the diagram, and copy an SVG.

The export to Mermaid feature is in beta. If you have any feedback, please [let us know on Discord](https://discord.gg/xstate).
