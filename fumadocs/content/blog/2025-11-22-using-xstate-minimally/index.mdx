intro - acknowledgement that xstate has a learning curve but that for many apps, most of the stuff isn't needed

what is xstate?

if you're not familiar, it is 2 things that work together:
- state machine and statechart implementation
- actor model implementation

state machine as a pure function

mathematical definition of transition function: given current state, returns next state (and optionally effects/output)

show transition(…) and initialTransition(…) and link to relevant docs

you can do the equivalent with a switch statement, but xstate handles nested states & more (statechart features) and provides a data structure for the state machine that can be traversed

## visualization

at its core, state machines form a directed graph: nodes are states, edges are transitions

branching achieved with guards

xstate provides a data model

## context & effects

xstate has the notion of assigning to context & executing actions; this can be handled in the state machine or they can be handled externally

xstate then becomes just the "blueprint"/oracle that answers "given current state and event, what is the next state?" and leaves the data & effect impl details up to the developer

this is the simplest way to use XState

# example: useReducer

# example: serverless

# when to use more of xstate

when essential logic gets complex
