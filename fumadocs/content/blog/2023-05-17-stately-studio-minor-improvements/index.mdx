Over the week we made the following improvements.

{/* truncate */}

- When copy and pasting states and transitions, the pasted layout is now much improved. [Watch a demo of copy paste in last weekâ€™s office hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPrZ19EKlJU&t=128s).
- The background of the **Live simulation** mode panel is now easier to read in light mode.
- A whole range of internal minor improvements and fixes.
