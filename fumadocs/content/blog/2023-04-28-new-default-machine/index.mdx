There’s now a more detailed default machine when you create a new machine in Stately Studio or when you jump straight into modeling at state.new.

{/* truncate */}

![Stately Studio machine featuring initial state, guards, parent and child states, and using descriptions.](https://canny.io/images/362e27b65f13dfe7ce6979a91a5fdd6c.png)

We hope this will help you get started and maybe learn more about features you’ve not used before.

If you don’t want any of these states and transitions in your new machine, you can drag to select all the unwanted features and hit backspace to delete them.

We’d love your thoughts about our new default machine; please [give us your feedback in our Discord!](https://discord.gg/xstate)
