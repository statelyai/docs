Cross-library comparison of `@statelyai/graph` against [graphology](https://graphology.github.io/), [ngraph](https://github.com/anvaka/ngraph.graph), [@dagrejs/graphlib](https://github.com/dagrejs/graphlib), and [cytoscape](https://js.cytoscape.org/) (headless) on seven workloads: graph construction, BFS reachability, single-pair shortest path, PageRank, connected components, betweenness centrality, and a full degree sweep.

Machine specifics matter — the absolute numbers below are from one machine on one day. **Reproduce them on your own hardware** with the commands in [Reproduce these results](#reproduce-these-results); the tables in this file are generated from that run's JSON, not hand-written.




- **Measured:** 2026-06-12 on Apple M1 Max (10 cores), node v25.9.0 (darwin/arm64). Library versions: graphology 0.26.0, ngraph 20.1.2, @dagrejs/graphlib 4.0.1, cytoscape 3.34.0.
- **Numbers are medians** (milliseconds) of ≥5 runs after warmup, within a 1.5 s sampling budget per cell.

Cell legend: **bold** = fastest for that row; `(n.n×)` = multiple of the fastest; `—` = the library has no equivalent API; `>10s` = skipped after a prior run exceeded 10 s; `crash` = the library threw (the error is recorded in the JSON results).

> **Sub-millisecond caveat:** cells under ~0.1 ms (notably scaleFree traversals, which reach few nodes from the start node) are dominated by call overhead. Treat their ratios as noise, in either direction.

## Build

Construct the graph from an identical node/edge list.

## BFS

Full directed reachability sweep from node 0. Libraries without a built-in traversal get a minimal queue loop over their neighbor API.

The scaleFree rows are sub-millisecond for everyone (few nodes are reachable from node 0); their ratios are noise.

## Single-pair shortest path (sssp)

Weighted shortest path from node 0 to node n−1. `@statelyai/graph` uses `getShortestPath` (bidirectional Dijkstra); graphology uses `dijkstra.bidirectional`; ngraph uses `ngraph.path` A\*. graphlib's only shortest-path API is full single-source Dijkstra, so its cell pays the all-targets cost — that is the cost a graphlib user pays for one query.

| graph | @statelyai/graph | graphology | ngraph | @dagrejs/graphlib | cytoscape (headless) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| random 1,000 | **0.04** | 0.11 (3.1×) | 0.36 (10.2×) | 2.8 (79.3×) | 25.8 (727.7×) |

| layeredDag 1,000 | **0.14** | 0.62 (4.4×) | 0.39 (2.8×) | 2.5 (17.8×) | 20.6 (145.6×) |
| random 10,000 | **0.17** | 0.30 (1.8×) | 3.7 (22.6×) | 23.7 (143.3×) | 333 (2015.8×) |
| scaleFree 10,000 | 0.07 (74.7×) | **0.00** | 0.01 (12.7×) | 6.5 (6827.4×) | 49.2 (51393.4×) |
| grid 10,000 | **0.71** | 15.6 (21.9×) | 3.2 (4.5×) | 18.5 (26.0×) | 206 (289.4×) |
| layeredDag 10,000 | **1.6** | 15.1 (9.2×) | 4.9 (3.0×) | 22.6 (13.8×) | 291 (177.1×) |
| random 100,000 | **0.93** | 4.6 (5.0×) | 272 (292.4×) | 501 (538.0×) | 6531 (7008.8×) |
| scaleFree 100,000 | 0.63 (652.7×) | **0.00** | 0.03 (33.9×) | 69.1 (72137.9×) | 650 (678045.5×) |
| grid 100,000 | **20.2** | 422 (20.9×) | 57.0 (2.8×) | 335 (16.6×) | 4163 (205.8×) |
| layeredDag 100,000 | **23.5** | 369 (15.7×) | 85.3 (3.6×) | 383 (16.3×) | 5162 (220.0×) |

graphology wins the scaleFree rows; on those graphs node n−1 is typically unreachable from node 0 and the search terminates almost immediately, so the cells are sub-millisecond for both bidirectional implementations.

## PageRank

| layeredDag 100,000 | **71.7** | 141 (2.0×) | — | — | crash |

ngraph and graphlib have no PageRank. cytoscape's PageRank threw `Invalid array length` on three of the four 100k graphs.

| layeredDag 100,000 | **4.5** | 149 (33.3×) | — | >10s | 8267 (1847.2×) |

graphlib's `alg.components` uses recursive DFS and overflowed the call stack (`Maximum call stack size exceeded`) at 10,000 nodes on the random, grid, and layeredDag graphs, and at 100,000 on scaleFree. Where it survived, it was 17–50× slower; the remaining 100k cells were skipped after exceeding 10 s.

## Betweenness centrality

Run only at n=1,000 — Brandes is O(V·E) for every library, so larger sizes are capped for everyone.

## Reading the numbers

Where `@statelyai/graph` is fastest:

- **Build** — fastest in every cell, 1.5–87× ahead. Plain-object graphs with lazy WeakMap indexing have very little construction overhead.
- **BFS** — fastest on every non-degenerate row, 4–15× ahead of the next library at 10k–100k.
- **Connected components** — fastest in every cell, 7–85× ahead of graphology (the next-fastest with the API).
- **Single-pair shortest path** — fastest on every row where the search does real work; bidirectional Dijkstra is why `random 100,000` completes in 0.93 ms while full single-source Dijkstra (graphlib) takes 501 ms.
- **PageRank and betweenness** — fastest in most cells, but only by 1.2–3.9× over graphology on PageRank (1.5–5.1× on betweenness), and graphology wins `grid` PageRank at 10,000 (5.3 vs 5.5 ms — effectively a tie). PageRank is at rough parity with graphology at small sizes, pulling ahead 2–4× at 100,000.

Where it is not fastest:

- **Degree sweep** — now at parity rather than a blowout: with `getDegree` made O(1), every cell lands within 1.1–2.3× of the fastest, where the previous run was 4–23× behind. ngraph is still the fastest library in 11 of the 12 degree cells (graphology takes `random 100,000`); `@statelyai/graph` wins no cell outright, though it now edges out graphology in three of the four 100k cells (scaleFree, grid, layeredDag). If per-node degree queries in a tight loop dominate your workload, ngraph remains the fastest choice — but the gap is now small.
- **scaleFree traversal/sssp cells** — graphlib posts the fastest BFS times and graphology the fastest sssp times on the scaleFree rows. These cells terminate after touching a handful of nodes and are mostly call overhead, but the raw numbers are what they are.

Other findings worth knowing regardless of which library you pick:

- graphlib's recursive-DFS `components` overflows the Node call stack at 10,000 nodes on three of the four graph shapes.
- cytoscape's PageRank throws `Invalid array length` at 100,000 nodes on three of the four shapes; headless cytoscape is generally 2–4 orders of magnitude slower across the board, which is unsurprising — it is a visualization toolkit, not an algorithms library.
- ngraph has no built-in PageRank, components, or betweenness; graphlib has no PageRank or betweenness.

## Reproduce these results

Everything needed to reproduce this is in the repo — there are no hidden steps and nothing is installed implicitly. The competitor libraries are ordinary `devDependencies`, so a single `pnpm install` at the repo root fetches them alongside the toolchain.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/statelyai/graph.git
cd graph
pnpm install            # installs @statelyai/graph's toolchain + every competitor lib

pnpm bench:compare:quick   # 1k + 10k sizes — finishes in a couple of minutes
pnpm bench:compare         # full 1k + 10k + 100k — several minutes, canonical sizes
```

Custom sizes without editing anything:

```bash
BENCH_SIZES=1000,25000 pnpm bench:compare
```

Each run writes three artifacts and never touches the network:

- `bench/compare/results/<date>.json` — machine-readable: every cell plus the captured environment (node version, OS/arch, CPU model, core count) and library versions.
- `bench/compare/results/<date>.md` — a self-contained snapshot table for that run.
- `docs/benchmarks.md` — the tables in *this* file are regenerated in place (between the `BENCH:TABLES` markers). The prose around them is preserved.

To rebuild the tables from an already-recorded JSON without re-running the benchmark (e.g. after editing the surrounding prose):

```bash
pnpm bench:report bench/compare/results/2026-06-12.json
```

**Expected runtime** (Apple M1 Max, node 24): quick ≈ 1–2 min, full ≈ 4–8 min. Slower machines scale roughly linearly; the 100k PageRank/components cells for cytoscape dominate the tail (cytoscape self-skips after exceeding 10 s).

**Note on CI:** a GitHub Actions workflow ([`.github/workflows/bench.yml`](./_assets/.github/workflows/bench.yml)) runs the quick variant on manual dispatch and uploads the JSON as an artifact. Shared CI runners are noisy and their absolute numbers are not canonical — that workflow exists to prove the harness runs end-to-end from a clean checkout, not to publish timings.

## Fairness notes

The benchmark tries hard not to flatter `@statelyai/graph`. Every adapter (see [`bench/compare/adapters.ts`](./_assets/bench/compare/adapters.ts)) builds from the *same* neutral integer edge list and calls each library through its **idiomatic public API** — the code a user would actually write, not a hand-tuned port. Where a library has no equivalent API, the cell is `—` rather than a home-grown reimplementation counted against the competitor. Per-library specifics:

- **`@statelyai/graph`** — BFS uses the public `bfs` generator; `sssp` uses `getShortestPath` (bidirectional Dijkstra); PageRank/components/betweenness/degree use their public functions. `getDegree` is O(1) after the recent index change; the degree-sweep numbers reflect that (and it still does not win the degree sweep).
- **graphology** — `sssp` uses `dijkstra.bidirectional` (a like-for-like single-pair search, its best-case API here). BFS is a minimal queue loop over `forEachOutNeighbor` because graphology has no built-in directed BFS; that is the same loop a graphology user would write, so it is a fair representation, not a handicap. PageRank and betweenness run with `getEdgeWeight: null` (unweighted), matching the unweighted call on our side.
- **ngraph** — `sssp` uses `ngraph.path`'s A\* with an admissible zero heuristic (`oriented: true`), its idiomatic pathfinder. ngraph ships no PageRank, connected-components, or betweenness, so those cells are `—`. Its degree sweep reads `getLinks(id).size`, which counts both directions — the closest public analogue to a degree query.
- **@dagrejs/graphlib** — its **only** shortest-path API is full single-source Dijkstra (`alg.dijkstra`), so the `sssp` cell pays the all-targets cost. This looks unflattering, but it is exactly what a graphlib user pays for one query — there is no single-pair shortcut to call. Its recursive-DFS `alg.components` genuinely overflows the stack at 10k+ nodes on most shapes; that is recorded as `crash`, a real result, not a harness bug. No PageRank or betweenness → `—`.
- **cytoscape (headless)** — run in `headless: true` mode so no rendering is timed. It is a visualization toolkit, not an algorithms library, and its 2–4 orders-of-magnitude slower numbers reflect the overhead of its element/collection model — included for completeness because people do reach for it as a graph library.

Two workloads are deliberately constrained for *everyone* to keep the comparison honest:

- **Betweenness** is capped at n=1,000 because Brandes is O(V·E) for every library — running it at 100k would just measure who allocates slightly less, over minutes.
- The **sub-millisecond scaleFree traversal/sssp cells** are noise: those searches touch a handful of nodes and are dominated by call overhead. The doc flags them explicitly rather than quietly claiming wins or losses there.

If you spot an adapter that misrepresents a library's best idiomatic API, that is a bug worth an issue or PR — the goal is numbers that survive scrutiny.

## Methodology

Source: [`bench/compare/run.ts`](./_assets/bench/compare/run.ts), [`bench/compare/generate.ts`](./_assets/bench/compare/generate.ts), [`bench/compare/adapters.ts`](./_assets/bench/compare/adapters.ts), [`bench/compare/report.ts`](./_assets/bench/compare/report.ts). Raw output: [`bench/compare/results/2026-06-12.md`](https://github.com/statelyai/graph/blob/main/bench/compare/results/2026-06-12.md) and [`2026-06-12.json`](./_assets/bench/compare/results/2026-06-12.json).

- **Identical inputs.** Seeded generators emit a neutral edge list (integer endpoints, weights); every library builds from the same list. Simple directed graphs only (no parallel edges or self-loops) — the lowest common denominator across libraries.
- **Four shapes × three sizes** (1,000 / 10,000 / 100,000 nodes):
  - `random` — uniform random, ~3 edges/node, with a spanning chain so traversals reach most of the graph
  - `scaleFree` — preferential attachment (k=3); hub-heavy, with most nodes unreachable from node 0
  - `grid` — square lattice with right/down directed edges
  - `layeredDag` — layered DAG with local fanout and occasional skip edges (statechart/workflow-like)
- **Idiomatic usage.** Each library runs through a thin adapter calling its public API the way a user would — no hand-tuned ports. Libraries lacking a built-in BFS get a minimal queue loop over their neighbor API. `—` means no equivalent API exists.
- **Timing.** One warmup run, then samples until ≥5 runs or a 1.5 s budget; the table reports the median.
- **`crash`** means the library threw during the workload (e.g. stack overflow, `Invalid array length`); the error message is recorded in the JSON. A crash is treated as a result, not a harness failure.
- **`>10s`** means a single run exceeded 10 s, so the workload was skipped for that library at that and larger sizes.
- **Fairness notes.** graphlib's only shortest-path API is full single-source Dijkstra, so its `sssp` cells pay the all-targets cost. Betweenness is capped at n=1,000 for every library because Brandes is O(V·E). See [Fairness notes](#fairness-notes) above for the full per-library breakdown.
