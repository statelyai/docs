title: Live simulation mode
---

import { Play, Triangle } from 'lucide-react';

Live simulation mode helps you share your simulated machine with your team without screen sharing or screenshots. Share the generated live simulation link, and your team can view your simulation in real-time and even trigger events themselves.

## Simulate your machine with others

You must be signed in to start a live simulation. Enter **Simulate** mode from the <Play size={18}/> **Simulate** button.

When you’re in **Simulate** mode, your current state and next available events are highlighted in blue to simulate the flow of your machine. Click the available events to transition through states and review your logic.
