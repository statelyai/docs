title: Share machine images using their image URL
---

import { LinkIcon, MoreHorizontal } from 'lucide-react';

You can share an image of your machine anywhere that supports images. You can use the image URL for live-updating images where the machine is always updated with your latest changes. Machine images can be helpful in documentation, including GitHub pull requests.

The image below is embedded using the copy image URL. Try switching between light and dark mode in the docs top bar; the image will change color mode too.

Your machine image will only be available if:

- the project visibility is **public** or **unlisted**

Machine images are not available for private machines.

Read [how to change a project’s visibility settings](projects.mdx#change-a-projects-visibility).

You can also [embed your machine](embed) for a focused non-editable view of your machine in Stately Studio’s editor.

## Copy the image URL

Use the <LinkIcon size={16} /> **Copy image URL** option from the <MoreHorizontal size={18} /> triple dot icon alongside your machine name.

## Color mode

By default, the image’s color mode will be the same as your chosen Stately Studio color mode. Add `.light.png` or `.dark.png` to the URL to force that color mode.

## Examples

The examples below show how you can use the image URL.
