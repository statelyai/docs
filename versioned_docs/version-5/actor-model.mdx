title: The actor model
---

When you run a state machine, it becomes an actor. In the actor model, actors are objects that can talk to each other via asynchronous messages. In XState, we refer to these messages as [**events**](transitions.mdx).

TODO: What are some good examples of actors in software development?

## State

An actor has its own internal, encapsulated state that the actor itself can only update. An actor may update its internal state in response to a message it receives, but it cannot be updated by any other entity. Actors do not share state. The only way for an actor to share data is by sending events.

[Read more about actors and state](actors.mdx).

## Communication with events

Actors communicate with other actors by sending and receiving events asynchronously. Actors use an internal “mailbox” that acts like an event queue, processing events one at a time.

[Read more about actors and events](actors.mdx).

## Spawning

Actors can spawn new actors. Actors will spawn new actors in situations where they need to delegate work to another actor or when they need to create a new actor to handle a new task. Spawning allows for a flexible and dynamic system where actors can be created and destroyed as needed to handle the workload efficiently.
