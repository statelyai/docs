title: Eventless (always) transitions

**Eventless transitions** are transitions without events. These transitions are *always* taken after any transition in their state is enabled.

Eventless transitions are labeled “always” and often referred to as “always” transitions.

## Make an event into an eventless transition

First, select the event you want to replace with an eventless transition. Then…

### Using the **quick actions** menu

1. Right-click the state to bring up the **quick actions** menu.
2. Choose **Always** from the **Event type** options.

### Using the **Transition details** panel

1. Open the **Transition details** panel from the right tool menu.
2. Choose **Always** from the **Event type** dropdown menu.
