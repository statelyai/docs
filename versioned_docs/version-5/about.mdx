## Stately Studio or XState?

Stately Studio and XState are most powerful when used together. Use Stately Studio’s visual editor to collaboratively model your app logic and use XState to integrate that logic into your codebase.

You can also use XState in your codebase without Stately Studio, and you’re welcome to use Stately Studio if you’re not yet familiar with XState. 

## Who is Stately?
