Stately Studio and XState are most powerful when used together. Use Stately Studio’s visual editor to collaboratively model your app logic and use XState to integrate that logic into your codebase.

<!-- Here I want to make it clear that you can start with either XState or Stately Studio, and bring them together later -->

You can also use XState in your codebase without Stately Studio, and you’re welcome to use Stately Studio if you’re not yet familiar with XState.
