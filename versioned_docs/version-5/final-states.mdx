title: Final states
---

import EmbedMachine from '@site/src/components/EmbedMachine';

A final state is a state that represents the completion or successful termination of a machine. It is defined by the `type: 'final'` property on a state node:

```ts
import { createMachine, interpret } from 'xstate';

const feedbackMachine = createMachine({
  initial: 'prompt',
  states: {
    prompt: {
      /* ... */
    },
    thanks: {
      /* ... */
    },
    // highlight-start
    closed: {
      type: 'final',
    },
    // highlight-end
    // ...
  },
  on: {
    'feedback.close': {
      target: '.closed',
    },
  },
});
```

When a machine reaches the final state, it can no longer receive any events, and anything running inside it is canceled and cleaned up. The box with a surrounding border icon represents the final state.

A machine can have multiple final states or no final states.

- A state machine can have zero or more final states. Some machines may run indefinitely and not need to terminate.
- Final states can have `output` data, which is sent to the parent machine when the machine terminates.
- When a machine reaches a top-level final state, it terminates.
- Final states cannot have transitions

<EmbedMachine name="Video player" embedURL="https://stately.ai/registry/editor/embed/e13bef2b-bb13-4465-96ac-0bc25340688e?machineId=c6f8ca35-25e3-4fc6-b4fe-c9994715852e" />

## Using final states in Stately Studio

In the video player above, *Stopped* is the final child state in the *Opened* state. When the video player is *Stopped*, the video player moves to its *Closed* state.

### Make a state a final state

First, select the state you want to set as the final state.

#### On the canvas

1. Right-click the state to open the edit menu.
2. From the **Type** options, choose **Final**.

#### Using the state Details panel

1. Select the state you want to set as the final state.
2. Open the state <Info size={18} /> **Details** panel from the right tool menu.
3. From the type option, choose **Final**.

To set the state back as a normal state, follow the same steps and select the **Normal** type option.

## Top-level final states

A top-level final state is a final state that is a direct child state of the machine. When the machine reaches a top-level final state, the machine will terminate. When a machine terminates, it can no longer receive events nor transition.

## Child final states

When a child final state of a compound state is reached, that compound state is considered "done". The `onDone` transition of that compound state is taken.

## Final states in parallel states

When all regions of a parallel state are "done", the parallel state is considered "done". The `onDone` transition of the parallel state is taken.

In this example, the `preparation` state is a parallel state with two regions: `beans` and `water`. When both regions are done, the `preparation` state is done, and the `brewing` state is entered.

```ts
import { createMachine, interpret } from 'xstate';

const coffeeMachine = createMachine({
  initial: 'preparation',
  states: {
    preparation: {
      type: 'parallel',
      states: {
        beans: {
          initial: 'grinding',
          states: {
            grinding: {
              on: {
                grindingComplete: 'ground',
              },
            },
            // highlight-start
            ground: {
              type: 'final',
            },
            // highlight-end
          },
        },
        water: {
          initial: 'heating',
          states: {
            heating: {
              always: {
                guard: 'waterBoiling',
                target: 'heated',
              },
            },
            // highlight-start
            heated: {
              type: 'final',
            },
            // highlight-end
          },
        },
      },
      // highlight-next-line
      onDone: 'brewing',
    },
    brewing: {},
  },
});
```

## Output

When a machine reaches its top-level final state, it can produce output data. You can specify this output data in the `.output` property of the top-level final state:

```ts
import { createMachine, interpret } from 'xstate';

const currencyMachine = createMachine({
  // ...
  states: {
    converting: {
      // ...
    },
    converted: {
      type: 'final',
      // highlight-start
      output: ({ context }) => ({
        amount: context.amount,
        currency: context.currency,
      }),
      // highlight-end
    },
  },
});

const currencyActor = interpret(currencyMachine, {
  input: {
    amount: 10,
    fromCurrency: 'USD',
    toCurrency: 'EUR',
  },
});

currencyActor.onDone(() => {
  console.log(currencyActor.getSnapshot().output);
  // logs e.g. { amount: 12, currency: 'EUR' }
});
```

- `.output` can also be a static value
