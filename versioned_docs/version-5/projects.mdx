A project is a collection of machines that helps you organize your personal machines and collaborate with others on your application logic.

You can access your projects from **My Projects** at the left of Stately Studio’s top bar when you’re signed into Stately Studio. **My Projects** lists your personal projects and is one of the locations where you can create new projects.

When you select a project, the first machine in the project will open in Stately Studio’s editor. The other machines in your project are accessible from the **Machines** list in the left drawer menu.

### Shared projects

Shared projects are available to [Teams](teams.mdx). Team projects are listed inside their Team in Stately Studio workspace.

### Change a project’s visibility

A project can be **public**, **unlisted**, or **private**. If the project is a shared team project, only team members with the **Owner** or **Admin** roles can change its visibility.

- Public projects are visible to everyone. They are discoverable on the [Discover](discover.mdx) page and listed on your profile page.
- Unlisted projects are visible to everyone with the project’s URL but are not findable on the Discover page or listed on your profile page.
- Private projects are only visible to you and the team that owns the project.

1. Use the **Share** button in Stately Studio’s top bar to open the Share dialog.
2. Toggle the project’s visibility between **public**, **unlisted**, or **private** from the dropdown menu in the Share dialog.

### Favorite a project

You can favorite your own projects and other people’s projects. Favoriting a project gives you easy access to these projects in the future, as your **Favorites** are listed in the left sidebar of Stately Studio’s workspace. You might want to favorite projects you find inspiring or educational so that you can refer back to them later.

You can favorite a project from **My Projects**, **Discover**, and team projects.

1. Choose **Add to favorites** from the <MoreHorizontal size={18} /> triple dot contextual menu alongside the project’s name.
2. Find your **Favorites** in the left sidebar of Stately Studio’s workspace.

#### Remove a project from your favorites

You can remove a project from your favorites from **Favorites**, **My Projects**, **Discover**, and team projects.

1. Choose **Remove from favorites** from the <MoreHorizontal size={18} /> triple dot contextual menu alongside the project’s name.
2. The project will no longer be listed under **Favorites**.
