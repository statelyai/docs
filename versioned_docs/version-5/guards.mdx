title: Guards
---

A **guard** is a condition function that the machine checks when it goes through an event. If the condition is `true`, the machine follows the transition to the next state. If the condition is `false`, the machine follows the rest of the conditions to the next state.

A **guarded transition** is a transition that is enabled only if its `guard` evaluates to `true`. The guard determines whether or not the transition can be enabled. Any transition can be a guarded transition.

Guards should be pure, synchronous functions that return either `true` or `false`.

```ts
const feedbackMachine = createMachine(
  {
    // ...
    states: {
      form: {
        on: {
          'feedback.submit': {
            // highlight-next-line
            guard: 'isValid',
            target: 'submitting',
          },
        },
      },
      submitting: {
        // ...
      },
    },
  },
  {
    // highlight-start
    guards: {
      isValid: ({ context }) => {
        return context.feedback.length > 0;
      },
    },
    // highlight-end
  },
);
```

## Using guards in Stately Studio

<p>
  <ThemedImage
    alt="A video player state machine with an initial Paused State and a Playing state. The transition from Playing to Paused has a guard numbered 1 and labeled ‘If time left is zero’. The first guard is joined to a second guard by a dotted line. The second guard is numbered 2 and is labeled ‘Else if time left is more than zero.’ The second guard’s transition targets the Playing state."

In Stately Studio, guards are numbered in the order they are checked and labeled with “if” or “else if” along with their condition. Multiple guards on the same events are connected with a dotted line.

Coming soon… Why you might use guards.

### Add a guard to an event

First, select the event where you want to add a guard. Then…

#### Using the **+ Transition** button

1. Use the **+ Transition** button to replace your event with a guarded transition.
2. Name your guard by replacing the **New guard** text inside the event.

#### Using the **quick actions** menu

1. Right-click the event to bring up the **quick actions** menu.
2. Choose **Add guard** from the options in the **quick actions** menu to replace your event with a guarded transition.
3. Name your guard by replacing the **New guard** text inside the event.

#### Using the **Transition details** panel

1. Open the **Transition details** panel from the right tool menu.
2. Use the **Guard** text input to name your guard and replace your event with a guarded transition.

Use the **+ Transition** button to create more guards on the same transition.

## Multiple guarded transitions

If you want to have a single event transition to different states in certain situations, you can supply an array of guarded transitions. Each transition will be tested in order, and the first transition whose `guard` evaluates to `true` will be taken.

You can specify a default transition to be taken as the last transition in the array. If none of the guards evaluate to `true`, the default transition will be taken.

```ts
const feedbackMachine = createMachine({
  // ...
  prompt: {
    on: {
      // highlight-start
      'feedback.provide': [
        // Taken if 'sentimentGood' guard evaluates to `true`
        {
          guard: 'sentimentGood',
          target: 'thanks',
        },
        // Taken if none of the above guarded transitions are taken
        // and if 'sentimentBad' guard evaluates to `true`
        {
          guard: 'sentimentBad',
          target: 'form',
        },
        // Default transition
        { target: 'form' },
      ],
      // highlight-end
    },
  },
});
```

## Inline guards

You can define guards as an inline function. This is useful for quickly prototyping logic but we generally recommended using serialized guards (strings or objects) for better reusability and visualization.

```ts
on: {
  event: {
    guard: ({ context, event }) => true,
    target: 'someState'
  }
}
```

## Guard object

A guard can be defined as an object with a `type`, which is the type of guard that references the provided guard implementation, and optional `params`, which can be read by the implemented guard:

```ts
const feedbackMachine = createMachine(
  {
    // ...
    states: {
      // ...
      form: {
        on: {
          submit: {
            // highlight-next-line
            guard: { type: 'isValid', params: { maxLength: 50 } },
            target: 'submitting',
          },
        },
      },
      // ...
    },
  },
  {
    // highlight-start
    guards: {
      isValid: ({ context, guard }) => {
        return (
          context.feedback.length > 0 &&
          context.feedback.length <= guard.maxLength
        );
      },
    },
    // highlight-end
  },
);
```

Guards can later be provided or overridden by providing custom guard implementations in the `.provide()` method:

```ts
const feedbackActor = interpret(
  // highlight-start
  feedbackMachine.provide({
    guards: {
      isValid: ({ context, guard }) => {
        return (
          context.feedback.length > 0 &&
          context.feedback.length <= guard.maxLength &&
          isNotSpam(context.feedback)
        );
      },
    },
  }),
  // highlight-end
).start();
```

## Higher-level guards

XState provides higher-level guards, which are guards that compose other guards. There are three higher-level guards – `and`, `or`, and `not`:

- `and([...])` - evaluates to `true` if all guards in `and([...guards])` evaluate to `true`
- `or([...])` - evaluates to `true` if _any_ guards in `or([...guards])` evaluate to `true`
- `not(...)` - evaluates to `true` if the guard in `not(guard)` evaluates to `false`

```ts
on: {
  event: {
    guard: and(['isValid', 'isAuthorized']);
  }
}
```

Higher-level guards can be combined:

```ts
on: {
  event: {
    guard: and(['isValid', or(['isAuthorized', 'isGuest'])]);
  }
}
```

## In-state guards

You can use the `stateIn(stateValue)` guard to check if the current state matches the provided `stateValue`. This is most useful for [parallel states](parallel-states.mdx).

```ts
on: {
  event: {
    guard: stateIn('#state1');
  },
  anotherEvent: {
    guard: stateIn({ form: 'submitting' })
  }
}
```

In-state guards match the state of the entire machine, not the state node. There usually isn't a need to use in-state guards for regular states. Try to model transitions in your state machines so that you don't need to use in-state guards first.

## Shorthands

It is recommended to define guards as guard objects, e.g. `{ type: 'someGuard', params: { ... } }`. However, if a guard has no params, you can specify it as a string:

```ts
on: {
  someEvent: {
    // Equivalent to:
    // guard: { type: 'someGuard' }
    // highlight-next-line
    guard: 'someGuard';
  }
}
```
