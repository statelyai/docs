title: Parallel states
---

import ThemedImage from '@theme/ThemedImage';

In statecharts, a parallel state is a state that has multiple child states (also known as **regions**) that are all active at the same time. This is different from a parent state, where only _one_ child state is active at a time.

Parallel states have the following characteristics:

- Entering a parallel state will also simultaneously enter all of its regions.
- Exiting a parallel state will also simultaneously exit all of its regions.
- An event received in a parallel state is simultaneously received & handled by all of its regions.

Here is a music player example with a parallel state consisting of two regions, one for handling playing the track and one for handling the volume:

```ts
import { createMachine, assign } from 'xstate';

const playerMachine = createMachine({
  id: 'player',
  // highlight-next-line
  type: 'parallel',
  states: {
    track: {
      initial: 'paused',
      states: {
        paused: {
          on: { PLAY: 'playing' },
        },
        playing: {
          on: { STOP: 'paused' },
        },
      },
    },
    volume: {
      initial: 'normal',
      states: {
        normal: {
          on: { MUTE: 'muted' },
        },
        muted: {
          on: { UNMUTE: 'normal' },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

The first region is the video state which is active at the same time as the audio state, and contains a playing and stopped state, with stop and play events. The other region is an audio state, which is active at the same time as the video state, and has muted and unmuted states, and unmute and mute events."

In the video player machine above, the video and audio states are active at the same time, which means the following combinations of states can happen simultaneously:

- video playing, audio muted
- video playing, audio unmuted
- video stopped, audio muted
- video stopped, audio unmuted

### Make a state a parallel state

First, select the parent state you want to set as a parallel state. Then…

#### Using the **quick actions** menu:

1. Right-click the state to bring up the **quick actions** menu.
2. Choose **Parallel** from the **Type** options.

#### Using the **State details** panel:

1. Select the parent state you want to set as the parallel state.
2. Open the **State details** panel from the right tool menu.
3. Choose **Parallel** from the **Type** dropdown menu.

## Parallel state value

The [state value](#todo) of a parallel state is an object with the state values of each of its regions.

```ts
const playerActor = interpret(playerMachine);
playerActor.start();

console.log(playerActor.getSnapshot().value);
// logs the object:
// {
//   track: 'paused',
//   volume: 'normal'
// }
```

## Modeling

_Coming soon_

- Avoid transitions between regions
- Used for separation of concerns that _may_ affect each other (i.e. synchronization)
- If completely separate, prefer `invoke` instead
