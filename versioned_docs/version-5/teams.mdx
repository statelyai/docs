By default, teams have only one member, the creator and Owner. [Invite new members](#invite-new-members-to-a-team) to add more members to your team.

## Edit the team name

1. Select the team from the left sidebar of the Studio workspace.
2. Navigate to the Settings tab.
3. Edit the team name and use the **Save changes** button to update your team name.

## Invite new members to a team

      light: useBaseUrl('/teams/pending-invitations.png'),
      dark: useBaseUrl('/teams/pending-invitations-dm.png'),
    }}
  />
</p>

The invitation will be sent to the invitee’s email address. The invitee will appear as a team member in the **Pending** section of the **Members** page until they accept the invitation. Once the invitation is accepted, the team member will be listed on the **Members** page, organized by role.

A subscription seat is only taken up at the time of accepting the invitation. Any particular team member is considered to occupy a single seat even if they are a member of more than one team.
