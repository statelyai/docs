# Eventless transitions (`always`)

In statecharts, an eventless transition is a transition that occurs without an explicit event. They are taken immediately after normal transitions are taken, if they are enabled (that is, if their guards are true (LINK)).

They are useful for doing things when some condition is true.

Warning: avoid infinite loops by using guards.
