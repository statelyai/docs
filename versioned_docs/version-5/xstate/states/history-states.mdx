# History states

<!-- deps: ["parent-and-child-states","transitions-and-events","targeting-children","targeting-children-of-siblings"] -->

When using statecharts, sometimes you’ll want to relaunch a process in a previous state.

In the example below, when you turn the fan off via `POWER_OFF`, then turn it back on, it will _always_ start in the `lowPower` state.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const fanMachine = createMachine({
  initial: 'powerOn',
  states: {
    powerOn: {
      on: {
        TURN_OFF: {
          target: 'powerOff',
        },
        SET_TO_LOW_POWER: {
          target: '.lowPower',
        },
        SET_TO_MEDIUM_POWER: {
          target: '.mediumPower',
        },
        SET_TO_HIGH_POWER: {
          target: '.highPower',
        },
      },
      initial: 'lowPower',
      states: {
        lowPower: {},
        mediumPower: {},
        highPower: {},
      },
    },
    powerOff: {
      on: {
        TURN_ON: {
          target: 'powerOn',
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

The example above isn’t a great user experience. Ideally, the fan would start with the same power level that the user last selected.

We can use a **history state** inside the `powerOn` state to enable that behavior. A history state, when reached, tells the machine to go to the last recorded child of its parent. In our case, when the machine returns to `powerOn`, it will select `lowPower`, `mediumPower` or `highPower`.

```ts twoslash {23-25, 33-38}
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const fanMachine = createMachine({
  initial: 'powerOn',
  states: {
    powerOn: {
      on: {
        TURN_OFF: {
          target: 'powerOff',
        },
        SET_TO_LOW_POWER: {
          target: '.lowPower',
        },
        SET_TO_MEDIUM_POWER: {
          target: '.mediumPower',
        },
        SET_TO_HIGH_POWER: {
          target: '.highPower',
        },
      },
      initial: 'lowPower',
      states: {
        hist: {
          type: 'history',
        },
        lowPower: {},
        mediumPower: {},
        highPower: {},
      },
    },
    powerOff: {
      on: {
        TURN_ON: {
          /**
           * Target the history node directly
           */
          target: 'powerOn.hist',
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

In the example above, we’ve changed the target of `TURN_ON` to target `powerOn.hist`. You need to target the history node directly. If you targeted `powerOn` instead of the history node, `TURN_ON` would default to `powerOn`'s initial state, `lowPower`.

### Avoid infinite loops with the history state

A history state can’t be specified as its parent’s initial state as this will result in an infinite loop.

## Types of history state

<!-- deps: ["history-states", "parallel-states"] -->

You can specify two types of history state:

- `shallow`, only the state at the same level as the history state node will be remembered.
- `deep`, all the state’s children will also be remembered.

You can specify these types on the state node itself by specifying `history: 'deep'`.

```js
{
  type: 'history',
  history: 'deep',
}
```

The default behavior of the history state is `shallow`, but `deep` is useful when you want to remember a complex state.

In the example below, the user can hide/show their video AND mute/unmute their microphone. When they leave the call to go to the `notOnCall` state, they can then rejoin the call via `JOIN_CALL`, which targets `onCall.hist`.

```ts twoslash
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const callMachine = createMachine({
  initial: 'onCall',
  states: {
    onCall: {
      type: 'parallel',
      on: {
        LEAVE_CALL: 'notOnCall',
      },
      states: {
        hist: {
          type: 'history',
          history: 'deep',
        },
        microphone: {
          initial: 'muted',
          states: {
            muted: {
              on: {
                UNMUTE: 'notMuted',
              },
            },
            notMuted: {
              on: {
                MUTE: 'muted',
              },
            },
          },
        },
        video: {
          initial: 'noVideo',
          states: {
            noVideo: {
              on: {
                SHOW_VIDEO: 'hasVideo',
              },
            },
            hasVideo: {
              on: {
                HIDE_VIDEO: 'noVideo',
              },
            },
          },
        },
      },
    },
    notOnCall: {
      on: {
        JOIN_CALL: 'onCall.hist',
      },
    },
  },
});
```

In the example above, the `deep` history state tracks:

- Whether `video` is in the `noVideo` or `hasVideo` state
- Whether `microphone` is in the `muted` or `unmuted` state.

Using the `deep` history state here means the user’s settings are automatically retained when they rejoin the call.

The above example _doesn't_ work with a `shallow` history as `shallow` only remembers one level deep, which means the `muted`/`unmuted` state would not be preserved.
