title: History states
---

A history state is a special type of state (a _pseudostate_) that remembers the last [child state](parent-states.mdx) that was active before its parent state is exited. When a transition from outside the parent state targets a history state, the remembered child state is entered.

This allows machines to "remember" where they left off when exiting and reentering a parent state.

- If no child state remembered, history goes to `.target` state, if it is specified
- Otherwise, go to [initial state](initial-states.mdx)

A history state returns the parent state to its most recently active child state. The box with an **H** inside represents the history state.

The history state can be deep or shallow:

- A shallow history state remembers the immediate child’s state.
- A deep history state remembers the deepest active state or states inside its child states.

TODO: Why you might use a history state with example.

## Stately Studio: history states

### Make a state a history state

First, select the state you want to set as a history state for the parent state. Then…

#### Using the **quick actions** menu

1. Right-click the state to bring up the **quick actions** menu.
2. Choose **History** from the **Type** options.

#### Using the **State details** panel

1. Select the state you want to set as the final state.
2. Open the **State details** panel from the right tool menu.
3. Choose **History** from the **Type** dropdown menu.
4. Use the **History** toggle that appears when the state has a **History Type** to choose between **Shallow** and **Deep** history options.

## Shallow vs. deep history

- Shallow history states only remember the last active direct child state.
- Deep history states remember all active descendant states.

```ts
const machine = createMachine({
  // ...
  initial: 'firstState',
  states: {
    hist: {
      type: 'history',
      history: 'deep', // or 'shallow' (default)
      target: 'someState', // optional
    },
    firstState: {},
    someState: {},
    anotherState: {},
  },
});
```
