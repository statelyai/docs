title: 'Invoke'
---

XState is based on the [actor model](actors.mdx). Invoked actors are managed by the state machine. Invoked actors are created and started when the state is entered, and stopped when the state is exited.

Coming soon… invoking an actor: `{ invoke: { src: ... } }`.

- Actors can also be invoked on the root of the machine. They last the lifetime of the machine

Coming soon… example of invoking an actor at root.

## Using invoked actors in Stately Studio

Invoked actors are are labeled on their invoking state with “Invoke /” followed by the actor’s source name and ID.

You can invoke multiple actors on a single state. Top-level final states cannot have invoked actors.

  name="video player"

In the video player above, the *startVideo* actor is invoked when the video player is in the *Opened* state.

### Invoke actors on a state

1. Select the state you want to invoke an actor.
2. Open the **State details** panel from the right tool menu.
3. Use the **+** plus icon alongside the **Invoked actors** to add a new action.
4. Add the source for the actor using the **src** text input.
5. Add the ID for the actor using the **ID** text input.
6. Save the invoked actor using the **Save** button.

### Invoke done events

An **invoke done event** transitions from a state once its invocation has been completed. An invoke done event is labeled “done:” followed by the invocation’s ID.

#### How to create invoke done events in Stately Studio

1. Select the state with an invoked actor where you want to add an invoke done event.
2. Drag from the handles on the left, right and bottom sides of the selected state, and release to create a connecting transition, event and new state.
3. The newly-created event will automatically be created as an invoke done event.

You can also change an existing event into an invoked done event using the **quick actions** menu:

1. Select the existing event you wish to change into an invoke done event.
2. Right-click the state to bring up the **quick actions** menu.
3. Choose **Invocation done event** from the **Event type** options.

### Invoke error events

An **invoke error event** transitions from a state when an error occurs in its invocation. An invoke error event is labeled “error:” followed by the invocation’s ID.

#### How to create invoke error events in Stately Studio

1. Select the state with an invoked actor where you want to add an invoke error event.
2. Drag from the handles on the left, right and bottom sides of the selected state, and release to create a connecting transition, event and new state.
3. The newly-created event will automatically be created as an invoke done event.
4. When an invoke done event already exists from that state, creating another event will automatically create that event as an invoke error event.

You can also change an existing event into an invoked error event using the **quick actions** menu:

1. Select the existing event you wish to change into an invoke error event.
2. Right-click the state to bring up the **quick actions** menu.
3. Choose **Invocation error event** from the **Event type** options.

## API

- `invoke: { src: ... }` - Invokes an actor.
  - `src` - The actor to invoke.
  - `id` - The ID of the actor.
  - `input` - The input to pass to the actor.
  - `systemId` - system-wide ID
  - `onDone`
  - `onSnapshot`
  - `onError`

## Source

- Represented by `src`
- Can be inline: `src: fromPromise(...)`
- Can be referenced: `src: 'fetchUser'`
- `.provide({ actors: ... })`

## Lifecycle

Invoked actors have a lifecycle that is managed by the parent machine. They are created and started when the state is entered, and stopped when the state is exited.

- Transitions that reenter the state stop invoked actors and start new invoked actors.
  - Don't want this? Set `reenter: false` or omit `reenter` altogether.

## Actor refs

Actors can be read on `state.children.<actorId>`. The returned value is an `ActorRef` object, and it has these properties:

- `id` - the ID of the actor
- `send()`
- `getSnapshot()`

## Actor snapshots

The actor snapshot is the latest emitted value from the actor. It can be read from `actorRef.getSnapshot()`.

- The snapshot is not the same as the internal state; it is what the actor chooses to share with observers.

## `onDone`

- Transitions when invoked actor is complete
- Event gets `.output` with actor's output data

## `onSnapshot`

- Transitions when invoked actor emits a new snapshot
- Event gets `data` with actor's snapshot

## `onError`

- Transitions when invoked actor throws an error
- Event gets `data` with actor's error data

## Input

- Actors can receive input. This is an event: `{ type: 'xstate.init', input: ... }`

## Kinds of actors

- [Promises](actors.mdx#promise-actors)
- [Machines](machines.mdx)
- [Observables](actors.mdx#observable-actors)
- [Transition functions](actors.mdx#transition-actors)
- [Callbacks](actors.mdx#callback-actors)
