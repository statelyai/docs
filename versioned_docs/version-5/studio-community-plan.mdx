# Stately Studio Community

**The Stately Studio will always be free to our Community users** on this free plan, and we will make many future features available on every plan. Request features and check out what we’ve got planned on [our roadmap](https://statelyai.canny.ai).

We offer a **30-day free trial** on the [Stately Studio Pro account](studio-pro-plan.mdx) so you can explore how our Pro features work for you and your team. You can [upgrade](upgrade.mdx) when you’re signed into the Stately Studio.
