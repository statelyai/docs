# Live Simulation Mode

Live simulation mode helps you share your simulated machine with your team without screen sharing or screenshots. Share the generated live simulation link, and your team can view your simulation in real-time and even trigger events themselves.

Live simulation is a Pro feature of the Studio. [Check out the features on our Pro plan](/studio-pro-plan.mdx) or [upgrade to try the Pro plan with a 7-day free trial](https://stately.ai/registry/billing).

## Simulate your machine with others

You must be signed in to start a live simulation. There are two views in Stately Studio’s editor: Design mode and Simulate mode.

1. Select the **Simulate** mode from the center of the visual editor.

:::tip

When you’re in **Simulate** mode, your current state and next available events are highlighted in blue to simulate the flow of your machine. Click the available events to transition through states and review your logic.

2. Use the **Live mode** button in the bottom left corner to reveal the **Live simulation** options.

    }}
  />
</p>

3. Choose **Start a live simulation** to start a live simulation session.

When your machine is in live simulation mode, the **Live simulation panel** will display in the bottom left corner with a six-character unique code (for example: 3KNYII) along with **Copy link** and **Stop** buttons. The current state and next events will also be highlighted in orange.

4. Give the link or unique session code to whoever you want to share your live simulation session with.

1. Select the **Simulate** mode from the center of the visual editor.
2. Use the **Live mode** button in the bottom left corner to reveal the **Live simulation** options.
3. Choose **Join a Live simulation** to join an existing live simulation mode session.
4. Enter the unique session code you’ve been provided into the text box.
