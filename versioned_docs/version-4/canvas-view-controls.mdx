title: Canvas view controls
---

You spend a lot of time on the canvas while designing and simulating state machines, so we’ve added view controls to help you navigate around your machines.

## Show/hide UI (user interface)

You can show and hide most of the Stately Studio user interface to help you focus on your machine.

1. Open the editor menu from the Stately icon in the top left of Stately Studio.
2. From the **View** submenu, toggle <Check size={18} /> **Show/hide UI** to show and hide the UI.

You can also use the <kbd>Command</kbd>/<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>.</kbd> keyboard shortcut to show and hide the UI.

:::tip

We’ve got [keyboard shortcuts](keyboard-shortcuts.mdx) for many of the view controls.

Below is a preview of a machine _with_ the UI hidden.
