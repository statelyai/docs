**Eventless transitions** are transitions without events. These transitions are *always* taken after any transition in their state is enabled.

Eventless transitions are labeled “always” and often referred to as “always” transitions.

## Make an event into an eventless transition

First, select the event you want to replace with an eventless transition. Then…

### On the canvas

1. Right-click the state to open the edit menu.
2. From the **Event type** options, choose **Always** to turn the event into an eventless transition.

### Using the transition Details panel

1. Open the transition <Info size={18} /> **Details** panel from the right tool menu.
2. From the **Event type** dropdown menu, choose **Always** to turn the event into an eventless transition.
