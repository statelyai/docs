A machine moves from state to state through **transitions**. Transitions are caused by events; when an event happens, the machine transitions to the next state.

Watch our [“Transitions and events” video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0qgP4RZyq58&list=PLvWgkXBB3dd4I_l-djWVU2UGPyBgKfnTQ&index=4) (1m50s).

:::

Transitions are “deterministic”; each combination of state and event always points to the same next state.

The arrows are transitions, and the rounded rectangles on the arrow’s lines are events. Each transition has a **source** state which comes before the transition, and a **target** state, which comes after the transition. The transition’s arrow starts from the source state and points to the target state.

In the video player machine above, the events are *PLAY* and *PAUSE*. The *Play* event transitions from the *Paused* state to the *Playing* state. The *Pause* event transitions from the *Playing* state to the *Paused* state.

## Add a transition and event

1. Select an existing state.
2. Press or drag from one of the <Plus size={18} /> handles on the left, right and bottom sides of the selected state, and release to create a connecting transition, event and new state.

## Change the source and target states for a transition or event

First select the transition or event you want to change. Then…

### On the canvas

1. Right-click the transition or event, or use the <MoreHorizontal size={18} /> triple dot icon button, to open the Edit menu.
2. Choose **Switch source and target**.

### Dragging the transition handles

1. Drag the transition’s handle connected to the source state to connect it to a new source state.
2. Drag the transition’s handle connected to the target state to connect it to a new target state.

### Using the transition details panel

1. Open the transition <Info size={18} /> **Details** panel from the right tool menu.
2. Choose a new source state from the **Source** dropdown options.
3. Choose a new target state from the **Target** dropdown options.
