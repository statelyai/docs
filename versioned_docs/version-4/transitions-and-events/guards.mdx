A **guard** is a condition that the machine checks when it goes through an event. If the condition is true, the machine follows the transition to the next state. If the condition is false, the machine follows the rest of the conditions to the next state. Any transition can be a guarded transition.

The first guard is joined to a second guard by a dotted line. The second guard is numbered 2 and is labeled ‘Else if time left is more than zero.’ The second guard’s transition targets the Playing state."

In the Stately Studio, guards are numbered in the order they are checked and labeled with “if” or “else if” along with their condition. Multiple guards on the same events are connected with a dotted line.

## Replace event with a guard

When multiple guard conditions are added to one transition, the guards will be numbered in order. The first guard will be labeled **IF** and subsequent guards will be labeled **ELSE**.

### On the canvas

1. Select the event you want to replace with a guarded transition.
2. Use the <Plus size={18} /> plus icon button to open the edit menu.
3. Choose **Guard condition** from the menu to add a guarded transition.
4. Enter your condition into the text input.

### Using the transition Details panel

1. Open the transition <Info size={18} /> **Details** panel from the right tool menu.
2. Use the **Guard** text input to name your guard’s condition and replace your event with a guarded transition.
