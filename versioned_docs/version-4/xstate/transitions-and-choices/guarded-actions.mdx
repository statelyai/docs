# Guarded actions

<!-- deps: ["actions", "guards", "transitions-and-events", "context"] -->

You can use actions and guards together to run actions conditionally on transitions.

```ts
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const atmMachine = createMachine(
  {
    context: {
      balance: 20,
    },
    initial: 'showingBalance',
    states: {
      showingBalance: {
        on: {
          WITHDRAW_TEN_DOLLARS: {
            cond: 'hasAtLeastTenDollars',
            actions: 'logTenDollarsComing',
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
  {
    guards: {
      hasAtLeastTenDollars: (context) => {
        return context.balance >= 10;
      },
    },
    actions: {
      logTenDollarsComing: () => {
        console.log(`Here's your ten dollars!`);
      },
    },
  },
);
```

In the example above, when the user withdraws ten dollars via `WITHDRAW_TEN_DOLLARS`, we check first if the balance in `context` has at least 10 dollars.

We can add an else condition to `WITHDRAW_TEN_DOLLARS` too:

```ts
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const atmMachine = createMachine(
  {
    context: {
      balance: 20,
    },
    initial: 'showingBalance',
    states: {
      showingBalance: {
        on: {
          // highlight-start
          WITHDRAW_TEN_DOLLARS: [
            {
              cond: 'hasAtLeastTenDollars',
              actions: 'logTenDollarsComing',
            },
            {
              actions: 'sayThereIsNotEnoughInTheAccount',
            },
          ],
          // highlight-end
        },
      },
    },
  },
  {
    guards: {
      hasAtLeastTenDollars: (context) => {
        return context.balance >= 10;
      },
    },
    actions: {
      logTenDollarsComing: () => {
        console.log(`Here's your ten dollars!`);
      },
      sayThereIsNotEnoughInTheAccount: () => {
        console.log('Not enough in the account!');
      },
    },
  },
);
```

In the example above, if we have at least ten dollars in the account, weâ€™ll log that the dollars are coming. Else, weâ€™ll log that thereâ€™s not enough in the account.

Remember, **the cond always runs _before_ the action**. XState first checks if it should run the action by running the `cond`, and only then runs the action.

<!-- TODO: write a tip (or section on its own) on using always to run actions on every transitionâ€¦ Sometimes youâ€™ll want to run actions on every branch of a transition. Read our tip for that use case below. \-->

## The `choose` action

<!-- deps: ["actions", "guards", "guarded-actions"] -->

The `choose()` built-in action is an alternative API for guarded actions. `choose` lets you pick which actions should be executed based on some conditions inside the action itself.

The `choose()` approach helps you be more flexible with where you run actions. For example, you can run actions inside an entry action:

```ts
import { actions, createMachine } from 'xstate';

const logMachine = createMachine(
  {
    entry: actions.choose([
      {
        cond: 'inBrowser',
        actions: 'alertUser',
      },
      {
        actions: 'logToUser',
      },
    ]),
  },
  {
    guards: {
      inBrowser: () => {
        return typeof window === 'undefined';
      },
    },
    actions: {
      alertUser: () => {
        alert('Hello, browser!');
      },
      logToUser: () => {
        console.log('Hello, server!');
      },
    },
  },
);
```

Like all built-in actions, you must apply the result of `choose()` directly to an `actions` attribute. The following example will not work:

```ts
import { actions, createMachine } from 'xstate';
const logMachine = createMachine({
  entry: () => {
    // ðŸš« The following action just returns an object,
    // it doesnâ€™t do anything
    actions.choose([
      {
        cond: 'inBrowser',
        actions: 'alertUser',
      },
      {
        actions: 'logToUser',
      },
    ]);
  },
});
```
