# Transition descriptions

:::warning

**Docs for XState v4 are no longer maintained** 

This page is no longer maintained as [XState V5 has been released](/blog/2023-12-01-xstate-v5).

[Read about descriptions in XState V5](/docs/descriptions).

:::

You can add descriptions to transitions to illustrate what they do.

This text is used by the [Visualizer](/tools/visualizer.mdx) and the [Studio Editor](/studio.mdx#studio-editor) to make the diagrams more descriptive.

```ts
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const machine = createMachine({
  on: {
    SAY_HELLO: {
      actions: 'sayHello',
      description: 'Runs the sayHello action',
    },
  },
});
```
