# After

<!-- deps: ["states", "transitions-and-events"] -->

Timeouts and intervals can be hard to manage in application code. Statecharts make it easy and declarative using the `after` syntax.

The example below is a statechart for a game where you need to push a button within 5 seconds, or you get timed out:

```ts
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const pushTheButtonGame = createMachine({
  initial: 'waitingForButtonPush',
  states: {
    waitingForButtonPush: {
      // highlight-start
      after: {
        5000: {
          target: 'timedOut',
          actions: 'logThatYouGotTimedOut',
        },
      },
      // highlight-end
      on: {
        PUSH_BUTTON: {
          actions: 'logSuccess',
          target: 'success',
        },
      },
    },
    success: {},
    timedOut: {},
  },
});
```

The `after` property is a keyed object. The key is the time you want to wait for in milliseconds (ms). You can also do conditional checks and if/else logic on the object, as with any transition.

One useful feature of the `after` declaration is that you don’t need to cancel the timers in your code. For example, if the `PUSH_BUTTON` event is received before the timeout finishes, the **timeout is automatically cancelled**. No `clearTimeout` needed.

You can also specify multiple delayed events on the same `after` declaration:

```ts
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const pushTheButtonGame = createMachine({
  initial: 'waitingForButtonPush',
  states: {
    waitingForButtonPush: {
      after: {
        // highlight-start
        4000: {
          actions: 'warnThatYouAreAboutToLose',
        },
        // highlight-end
        5000: {
          target: 'timedOut',
          actions: 'logThatYouGotTimedOut',
        },
      },
      on: {
        PUSH_BUTTON: {
          actions: 'logSuccess',
          target: 'success',
        },
      },
    },
    success: {},
    timedOut: {},
  },
});
```

In the example above, the machine warns you when there’s one second remaining and then transitions.

## Dynamic delays

<!-- deps: ["after", "options-api"] -->

Sometimes you’ll want the length of time waited in an `after` transition to be dynamic. A dynamic delay is specified by passing a string reference instead of the number of milliseconds.

Dynamic delays can either pass in a number or pass a function that returns the delay.

In the example below, `YELLOW_DELAY` passes a number, and `GREEN_DELAY` passes a function.

```ts
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const lightDelayMachine = createMachine(
  {
    initial: 'green',
    context: {
      trafficLevel: 'low',
    },
    states: {
      green: {
        after: {
          // after the GREEN_DELAY, transition to yellow
          GREEN_DELAY: { target: 'yellow' },
        },
      },
      yellow: {
        after: {
          // after the YELLOW_DELAY, transition to red
          YELLOW_DELAY: { target: 'red' },
        },
      },
      red: {},
    },
  },
  {
    delays: {
      GREEN_DELAY: (context, event) => {
        return context.trafficLevel === 'low' ? 1000 : 3000;
      },
      YELLOW_DELAY: 500,
    },
  },
);
```
