[Read about installation for XState v5](/docs/installation).

:::

You can install XState using your favorite package manager or embed the `<script>` directly from a CDN.

## Installation Snippets

```bash title="using yarn"
yarn add xstate
```

```bash title="using npm"
npm install xstate
```

## CDN

You can embed XState from the [unpkg CDN](https://unpkg.com/xstate@4/dist/):

- XState core: [https://unpkg.com/xstate@4/dist/xstate.js](https://unpkg.com/xstate@4/dist/xstate.js)
- XState web: [https://unpkg.com/xstate@4/dist/xstate.web.js](https://unpkg.com/xstate@4/dist/xstate.web.js)
  - Browser-friendly, ES module build

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/xstate@4/dist/xstate.js"></script>
```

The variable `XState` will be available globally, which will give you access to the top-level exports.

```js
const { createMachine, actions, interpret } = XState; // global variable: window.XState

const lightMachine = createMachine({
  // ...
});

const lightActor = interpret(lightMachine);
```
