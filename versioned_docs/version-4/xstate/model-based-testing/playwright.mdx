# Playwright

Integrating with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) is simple with `@xstate/test`.

```ts
import { createTestMachine, createTestModel } from '@xstate/test';
import { test } from '@playwright/test';

const machine = createTestMachine({
  // machine config
});

describe('My app', () => {
  createTestModel(machine)
    .getPaths()
    .forEach((path) => {
      test(path.description, async ({ page }) => {
        await path.test({
          states: {},
          events: {},
        });
      });
    });
});
```
