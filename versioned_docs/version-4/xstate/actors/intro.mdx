When you run a statechart, it becomes an _actor_, a running process that can receive events. Often, you’ll need your actor to run _other actors_; spawning new statecharts, waiting for promises, or subscribing to observables.

We use the `invoke` attribute on a state to _invoke_ an actor in our machine. You can invoke an actor on any state, including the root node.

```ts
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const machine = createMachine(
  {
    invoke: {
      src: 'someActor',
    },
  },
  {
    // `actors` in v5
    services: {
      /**
       * The actor is defined here
       */
      someActor: async () => {},
    },
  },
);
```

You can also run several invocations at the same time by specifying `invoke` as an array:

```ts
import { createMachine } from 'xstate';

const machine = createMachine(
  {
    invoke: [
      {
        src: 'someActor',
      },
      {
        src: 'someOtherActor',
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    // `actors` in v5
    services: {
      someActor: async () => {},
      someOtherActor: async () => {},
    },
  },
);
```

Running several invocations simultaneously is useful when you want several sub-processes running on the same state.
