While the statechart is running, it can execute other effects called actions.

An action can be fired upon entry or exit of a state. Actions are “fire-and-forget effects”; once the machine has fired the action, it moves on and forgets the action. You can also fire actions on transitions.

Watch our [“Entry actions and exit actions” video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYoYZ1Dt1sA&list=PLvWgkXBB3dd4I_l-djWVU2UGPyBgKfnTQ&index=8) (1m32s).

You can fire multiple entry and exit actions on a state. Top-level final states cannot have exit actions, since the machine is stopped and no further transitions can occur.

The Playing state has an entry action for starting a video playing indicated by the ‘Entry’ label and the text playVideo, and an exit action for pausing a video indicated by the ‘Exit’ lable and the text pauseVideo. The Opened state contains Playing and Paused states, which are transitioned between using the Pause and Play events. There’s a Stop event from the Opened state that transitions to the final state of Stopped. There’s an onDone event from the parent Opened state back to the Closed state."

In our video player, we have entry and exit actions on the Playing state. We use the entry action of playVideo to fire an effect playing the video on entry to the Playing state. We use the exit action of pauseVideo to fire an effect pausing the video when the Playing state is exited.

## Add a built-in action

You can add built-in XState actions which will be formatted in your [exported code](/export-as-code.mdx). The options are:

- [assign](../xstate/actions/context.mdx#assign-action): assigns data to the state context.
- [raise](../xstate/actions/built-in-actions.mdx#raise-action): _raises_ an event that is received by the same machine.
- [log](../xstate/actions/built-in-actions.mdx#log-action): an easy way to log messages to the console.
- [sendTo](../xstate/actions/built-in-actions.mdx#sending-events-to-actors): sends an event to a specific actor.
- [stop](/xstate/actors/spawn.mdx#stopping-spawned-actors): stops a child actor.

To add a built-in action, first add a [transition action](#add-a-transition-action), [entry action](#add-an-entry-action-or-exit-action-to-a-state), or [exit action](#add-an-entry-action-or-exit-action-to-a-state).

### On the canvas

1. Hover, focus, or select the action block to reveal the <Edit size={18} /> edit icon button.
2. Use the <Edit size={18} /> edit icon button to open the **Action** panel.
3. Choose your desired action from the dropdown menu at the top of the **Action** panel.
4. Fill out the required corresponding action input fields.

### Using the details panel

1. Open the state, or event <Info size={18} /> **Details** panel from the right tool menu.
1. Hover, focus, or select the action block to reveal the <Edit size={18} /> edit icon button.
1. Use the <Edit size={18} /> edit icon button to open the **Action** panel.
1. Choose your desired action from the dropdown menu at the top of the **Action** panel.
1. Fill out the required corresponding action input fields.

## Add a custom action

You can also add custom actions with a custom action type and parameters which will be formatted as [XState action objects](../xstate/actions/actions.mdx) in your [exported code](/export-as-code.mdx).

First, add a [transition action](#add-a-transition-action), [entry action](#add-an-entry-action-or-exit-action-to-a-state), or [exit action](#add-an-entry-action-or-exit-action-to-a-state).

### On the canvas

1. Hover, focus, or select the action block to reveal the <Edit size={18} /> edit icon button.
2. Use the <Edit size={18} /> edit icon button to open the **Action** panel.
3. Custom action is selected by default. Add your custom action type in the **Action type** text input.
4. Add your custom **Action parameters** using the **Parameter key** and **Parameter value** text input pairs.

[Read about action objects below for more on action types and and parameters](../xstate/actions).

### Using the details panel
