title: Descriptions
---

You can add descriptions to state and event nodes to describe their purpose and share related notes with your team. Descriptions support markdown formatting, including links and images.

You can only add one description for each state or event. The machine object will include your descriptions in the state or event’s `description` when you export your statecharts to JSON.
