States can contain more states, also known as **child states**. These child states are only active when the parent state is active.

Child states are nested inside their parent states.

In the video player above, the *Opened* state is a parent state to the *Playing*, *Paused*, and *Stopped* states. These states, their transitions, and their events are nested inside the *Opened* state.
