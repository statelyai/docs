A history state returns the parent state to its most recently active child state. The box with an **H** inside represents the history state.

The history state can be deep or shallow:

- A shallow history state remembers the immediate child’s state.
- A deep history state remembers the deepest active state or states inside its child states.

## Make a state a history state

First, select the state you want to set as a history state for the parent state. Then…

### Using the **quick actions** menu

1. Right-click the state to open the **quick actions** menu.
2. Choose **History** from the **Type** options.

### Using the **State details** panel

1. Select the state you want to set as the final state.
2. Open the **State details** panel from the right tool menu.
3. Choose **History** from the **Type** dropdown menu.
4. Use the **History** toggle that appears when the state has a **History Type** to choose between **Shallow** and **Deep** history options.
