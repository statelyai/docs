## NonReducibleUnknown type

`T | unknown` reduces to `unknown` and that can be problematic when it comes to contextual typing. It especially is a problem when the union has a function member, like here:

```ts
declare function test(cbOrVal: ((arg: number) => unknown) | unknown): void;
test((arg) => {}) // oops, implicit any
```
This type can be used to avoid this problem. This union represents the same value space as `unknown`<></>.

**Signature:**

```typescript
export type NonReducibleUnknown = {} | null | undefined;
```
