      <p class="last-updated">Last updated February 24, 2021.</p>

      <h2 id="our-pledge">Our Pledge</h2>
      <p>
        In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
        contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our
        project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone,
        regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex
        characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience,
        education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
        race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
      </p>
      <h2 id="our-standards">Our Standards</h2>
      <p>
        Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
        include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Using welcoming and inclusive language</li>
        <li>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</li>
        <li>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</li>
        <li>Focusing on what is best for the community</li>
        <li>Showing empathy towards other community members</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual
          attention or advances
        </li>
        <li>
          Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political
          attacks
        </li>
        <li>Public or private harassment</li>
        <li>
          Publishing others&#39; private information, such as a physical or
          electronic address, without explicit permission
        </li>
        <li>
          Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
          professional setting
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="our-responsibilities">Our Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of
        acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair
        corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit,
        or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other
        contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban
        temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they
        deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
      </p>
      <h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
      <p>
        This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public
        spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
        Examples of representing a project or community include using an
        official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media
        account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or
        offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and
        clarified by project maintainers.
      </p>
      <h2 id="enforcement">Enforcement</h2>
      <p>
        Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may
        be reported by contacting the project team at team@stately.ai. All
        complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a
        response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
        The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to
        the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement
        policies may be posted separately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in
        good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined
        by other members of the project&#39;s leadership.
      </p>
