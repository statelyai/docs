Two weeks ago, we had what some have called our “best office hours yet.” We introduced a whole bunch of new features and improvements to Stately Studio, including [state.new](https://state.new?source=blog) with our new starter machine, annotations, embed mode, and version history. We also gave the first peek at our most significant editor update to date; we call it “codename: blocks,” check out the video to find out why!

We also talk about XState v5 being in beta (more on that soon!) and [how to migrate from XState V4 to V5](https://stately.ai/docs/xstate-v5/migration).
