We launched a huge release last week, but we already have more for you! In the last week, we made the following bug fixes and improvements.

## Autosave for Pro users

Machine versions are now automatically saved for Pro users every hour. Once created, these versions appear in the list of versions and function just like other versions, with the ability to view, restore, delete, etc. Users can toggle to filter auto-saved versions out of the version history list. A version is also auto-saved when the user’s browser window is closed.

## Filter machines

Got a really long list of machines in your project? You can now filter these machines by name.

## Bug fixes

- Importing machines without names will no longer cause errors in Safari.
- The zoom controls now slide out of the way of the Help drawer when it’s toggled open and closed.
- The reset button now slides out of the way of the Help drawer when it’s toggled open and closed in Simulate mode.

## Improvements

- States are now exported in a predictable, intuitive order, regardless of the order you added them. Initial states will be first, and the order of states will tend to follow transitions, with the “furthest” states being last.
- You will now be prompted to sign in when accessing features that require login.
- Improved accessibility of dropdown menus.
- An assortment of internal fixes and improvements.
