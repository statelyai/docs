## Bug fixes

- Default action implementations have now been fixed so that the correct default implementation is applied for both XState V4 and XState V5.
- The Learn Stately video modal will no longer show in machine images.

## Improvements

- If you’re new to Stately, you’ll now get a notification with the option to view the Learn Stately videos instead of the modal opening immediately.
- A plethora of internal fixes and improvements.
