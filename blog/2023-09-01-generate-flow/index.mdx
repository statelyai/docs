As a Stately Pro user, you can now auto-create machines from text descriptions with our new experimental feature, **Generate flow**. You can generate a flow for a new machine or use the flow description to describe how you want to modify your current flow.

There are so many reasons you might want to generate your flows, including:

- You have a complex machine in mind and want to get started quickly
- You want an example of a state machine for a particular flow
- You’re new and want to get an idea of how you can model state machines

With 1000 calls a month, and a [free 7-day Pro trial](https://stately.ai/pricing), get ready to create state machines in no time!
