In the last week, we made the following bug fixes and improvements.

<!--truncate-->

## Bug fixes

- Annotations will no longer cause validation warnings and errors when exporting machines.
- You can no longer create annotations or access autolayout from embedded mode. The embedded mode will also no longer show a banner when a new version of Stately Studio is available.

## Improvements

- You can no longer simulate a machine that has errors. So fix those errors before you head over to Simulate mode!
- You can now resize the left sidebar to an even smaller width.
- Viewing somebody else’s machine in Discovery will no longer show a banner telling you the machine is view-only.
- The meta value field now auto-resizes to fit the content.
- An array of internal fixes and improvements.
