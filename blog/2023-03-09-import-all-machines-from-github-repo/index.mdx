Last month, Anders showed you how you could [import a machine from GitHub by changing the GitHub URL in the browser’s address bar](/blog/2023-02-06-github-import-machines/index.mdx). We’ve added more to our GitHub integration. Our [Pro](https://stately.ai/pricing) users can now import all the machines from a repository into a Stately Studio project with the **Import from GitHub** button.

If you’ve been working with state machines in XState or using the [XState VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=statelyai.stately-vscode) to visualize your machines, this is a great way to import all the machines in your repo quickly. Once you’ve imported your machines into the Stately Studio, you can visualize and improve them in our Editor and easily share your machines with your team.

## How to import all the machines from a GitHub repository

1. Navigate to **My Projects** from the sidebar or the Stately menu.
2. Use **Import from GitHub** to open the Import repo from GitHub modal.
3. The GitHub integration will fetch all available repositories (public and private).
4. Choose the repository from which you wish to import machines.
5. The Studio will import your machines into a new private project using the same name as your repository and open your project in the Editor.

Importing a machine with **Import from GitHub** or importing a machine with a GitHub URL will prompt you to **Allow integration** to give our GitHub integration access to your GitHub repositories. You will only be prompted if you have not yet given the GitHub integration access on your current device.

Currently, the **Import from GitHub** feature imports all machines from the _default branch_ in your GitHub repository. If you want to import machines from a different branch or a pull request, we recommend [importing each machine from a GitHub URL](/blog/2023-02-06-github-import-machines/index.mdx).
