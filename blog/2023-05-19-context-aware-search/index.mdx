The search results in the [Stately Studio and XState docs](https://stately.ai/docs) are now context-aware. So if you’re browsing the current XState V4 version of the docs, you’ll get results for V4, and if you’re browsing the XState V5 beta version of the docs, you’ll get results for V5.

![Side-by-side comparison of search results for cond in the Stately docs. In the V4 docs, it gives you results about combining cond and in. In the V5 docs, it gives you results telling you to use guard instead of cond.](https://canny.io/images/0a39d4269b59a7a5268b9b85bf0a172a.png)

Thanks to Chev for bringing this up in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/xstate), Tobi for suggesting the solution, and Anders for quickly implementing it! If you have any feedback about our docs, please let us know in our [#documentation channel in Discord](https://discord.gg/xstate).
