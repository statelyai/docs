              Every team where I introduced XState has been more effective at
              handling state management with complex user interfaces. It fills a
              gap in the JS ecosystem no other tool did before.

              XState is a revelation. It makes complex tasks easier to build and
              debug while also making the code more straightforward and
              approachable.

              XState naturally separates the logic and makes it simple to mock
              out API calls, so it's easier to test the code and organize it!

              We use XState to implement business workflows as statecharts. The
              visualizer helps us collaborate more closely with customers, the
              ability to externalize workflows as JSON configuration makes
              complex workflow changes surprisingly simple to roll out, and test
              case generation makes it easier than ever to move forward with
              confidence. XState makes it all possible!

              Thinking and building with XState has been a revolution in how I
              develop robust business logic. But being able to visualize that in
              real time, has been a game changer in how I model and communicate
              any logic!
