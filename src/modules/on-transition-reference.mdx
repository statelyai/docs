Listeners for state transitions are registered via the `.onTransition(...)` method, which takes a state listener. State listeners are called every time a state transition (including the initial state) happens, with the current [`state` instance](./states.md):

```js
// Interpret the machine
const actor = interpret(machine);

// Add a state listener, which is called whenever a state transition occurs.
actor.onTransition((state) => {
  console.log(state.value);
});

actor.start();
```

<!-- ::: tip \-->

If you only want the `.onTransition(...)` handler(s) to be called when the state changes (that is, when the `state.value` changes, the `state.context` changes, or there are new `state.actions`), use [`state.changed`](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/states.html#state-changed):

```js {2}
actor.onTransition((state) => {
  if (state.changed) {
    console.log(state.value);
  }
});
```

<!-- ::: tip \-->

The `.onTransition()` callback will not run between eventless ("always") transitions or other microsteps. It only runs on macrosteps.
Microsteps are the intermediate transitions between macrosteps.
