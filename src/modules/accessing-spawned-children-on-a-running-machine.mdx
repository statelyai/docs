# Accessing spawned children on a running machine

## Syncing and Reading State

One of the main tenets of the Actor model is that actor state is _private_ and _local_ - it is never shared unless the actor chooses to share it, via message passing. Sticking with this model, an actor can _notify_ its parent whenever its state changes by sending it a special "update" event with its latest state. In other words, parent actors can subscribe to their child actors' states.

To do this, set `{ sync: true }` as an option to `spawn(...)`:

```js {4}
// ...
{
  actions: assign({
    // Actor will send update event to parent whenever its state changes
    someRef: () => spawn(todoMachine, { sync: true }),
  });
}
// ...
```

This will automatically subscribe the machine to the spawned child machine's state, which is kept updated and can be accessed via `getSnapshot()`:

```js
someActor.onTransition((state) => {
  const { someRef } = state.context;

  console.log(someRef.getSnapshot());
  // => State {
  //   value: ...,
  //   context: ...
  // }
});
```

```js
someActor.onTransition((state) => {
  const { someRef } = state.context;

  console.log(someRef.state);
  // => State {
  //   value: ...,
  //   context: ...
  // }
});
```

<!-- ::: warning \-->
By default, `sync` is set to `false`. Never read an actor's `.state` when `sync` is disabled; otherwise, you will end up referencing stale state.
