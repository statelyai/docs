# Privacy policy

Last updated August 2023, adding [Connecting actors](#connecting-actors) as we now use Partykit internally.

## Analytics

We use Plausible Analytics to collect aggregated statistics about your visits to Stately’s websites. The statistics include information such as pageviews, visit duration, visitors’ countries and devices. The aggregated statistics have no way to identify individuals from that data, and no data about any specific individual.

[Plausible’s privacy information](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics).

We track how you use Stately Studio and use Mixpanel to analyze the activity data. With your consent in the Studio settings, we attribute your hashed user id to the activity data. Analyzing patterns in user activity helps us understand how you use our tools and how we might improve your experience.

## Survey

We use Google Forms for our surveys. Your survey responses are stored with Google. We do not collect any information about you except what you provide in your responses, and you’re not required to provide your email address unless you consent to further contact from us.

If you would like us to delete your survey responses, please email jenny@stately.ai.
