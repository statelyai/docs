## Analytics

We use Plausible Analytics to collect aggregated statistics about your visits to Stately’s websites.

We track how you use Stately Studio and use Mixpanel to analyze the activity data. With your consent in the Studio settings, we attribute your hashed user id to the activity data. Analyzing patterns in user activity helps us understand how you use our tools and how we might improve your experience.
